id="overview"><a href="#overview" class="header-anchor">#</a> Overview</h2> <p>The Payment Initiation API Profile describes the flows and common functionality for the Payment Initiation API, which allows a Payment Initiation Service Provider ('PISP') to:</p> <ul><li>Register an intent to <strong>stage</strong> a payment-order consent.</li> <li>Optionally confirm available funds for a payment-order
<ul><li>Domestic immediate, international immediate and international scheduled (immediate debit) payments only.</li></ul></li> <li>Subsequently <strong>submit</strong> the payment-order for processing.</li> <li>Optionally retrieve the status of a payment-order <strong>consent</strong> or payment-order <strong>resource</strong>.</li></ul> <p>This profile should be read in conjunction with a compatible Read/Write Data API Profile which provides a description of the elements that are common across all the Read/Write Data APIs, and compatible individual resources.</p> <h3 id="document-overview"><a href="#document-overview" class="header-anchor">#</a> Document Overview</h3> <p>This document consists of the following parts:</p> <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Provides an overview of the profile.</p> <p><strong>Basics:</strong> Identifies the flows, restrictions and release management.</p> <p><strong>Security &amp; Access Control:</strong> Specifies the means for PISPs and PSUs to authenticate themselves and provide consent.</p> <p><strong>Data Model:</strong> Documents mappings and enumerations that apply to all the end-points.</p> <p><strong>Alternative Flows:</strong> Documents rules for alternative flows.</p> <h3 id="resources"><a href="#resources" class="header-anchor">#</a> Resources</h3> <p>Each of the Payment Initiation API resources are documented in the  <a href="../resources%20and%20data%20models/pisp">Resources and Data Models  /  PISP</a> area of the specification.

Due diligence has been carried out to ensure that the API has the necessary fields to function with Bacs payments as per the agreed scope.</p> <p>Further mapping guidance has been provided to ensure that differences are understood between the Open Banking Payment API standard, and other message formats in the Domestic Payment Message Formats sub-page.</p> <h4 id="status-codes"><a href="#status-codes" class="header-anchor">#</a> Status Codes</h4> <p>The API uses two status codes that serve two different purposes:</p> <ul><li>The HTTP Status Code reflects the outcome of the API call (the HTTP operation on the resource).</li> <li>The Status field for the payment-order consent reflects the status of the PSU consent authorisation.</li> <li>The Status field for the payment-order resource reflects the status of the payment-order initiation or execution.</li></ul> <h2 id="basics"><a href="#basics" class="header-anchor">#</a> Basics</h2> <h3 id="overview-2"><a href="#overview-2" class="header-anchor">#</a> Overview</h3> <p>The figure below provides a <strong>general</strong> outline of a payment flow for all payment-order types using the Payment APIs. The payment-order types covered in this profile include:</p> <ul><li>Domestic payments.</li> <li>Domestic scheduled payments.</li> <li>Domestic standing orders.</li> <li>International payments.</li> <li>International scheduled payments.</li></ul> <p>The payment-order consent and payment-order resource in the following flow generalises for the different payment-order types. e.g. for a domestic payment, the payment-order consent resource is domestic-payment-consents; and the payment-order resource is domestic-payments.</p> <p><img src="/read-write-api-docs-pub/assets/img/PaymentStatusModelTriangle.15d76462.png" alt="Payments Flow"></p> <h4 id="steps"><a href="#steps" class="header-anchor">#</a> Steps</h4> <p>Step 1: Agree Payment-Order Initiation</p> <ul><li>This flow begins with a PSU consenting to a payment being made. The consent is between the PSU and the PISP.</li> <li>The debtor account details can optionally be specified at this stage.</li></ul> <p>Step 2: Setup Payment-Order Consent</p> <ul><li>The PISP connects to the ASPSP that services the PSU's payment account and creates a new <strong>payment-order consent</strong> resource. This informs the ASPSP that one of its PSUs intends to make a <strong>payment-order</strong>. The ASPSP responds with an identifier for the payment-order consent resource (the ConsentId, which is the intent identifier).</li> <li>This step is carried out by making a <strong>POST</strong> request to the <strong>payment-order consent</strong> resource.</li></ul> <p>Step 3: Authorise Consent</p> <ul><li>The PISP requests the PSU to authorise the consent. The ASPSP may carry this out by using a <em>redirection flow</em> or a <em>decoupled flow</em>.
<ul><li>In a redirection flow, the PISP redirects the PSU to the ASPSP.
<ul><li>The redirect includes the ConsentId generated in the previous step.</li> <li>This allows the ASPSP to correlate the payment order consent that was setup.</li> <li>The ASPSP authenticates the PSU.</li> <li>The PSU selects the debtor account at this stage (if it has not been previously specified in Step 1).</li> <li>The ASPSP updates the state of the payment order consent resource internally to indicate that the consent has been authorised.</li> <li>Once the consent has been authorised, the PSU is redirected back to the PISP.</li></ul></li> <li>In a decoupled flow, the ASPSP requests the PSU to authorise consent on an  <em>authentication device</em> that is separate from the  <em>consumption device</em> on which the PSU is interacting with the PISP.
<ul><li>The decoupled flow is initiated by the PISP calling a back-channel authorisation request.</li> <li>The request contains a 'hint' that identifies the PSU paired with the consent to be authorised.</li> <li>The ASPSP authenticates the PSU</li> <li>The PSU selects the debtor account at this stage (if it has not been previously specified in Step 1)</li> <li>The ASPSP updates the state of the payment order consent resource internally to indicate that the consent has been authorised.</li> <li>Once the consent has been authorised, the ASPSP can make a callback to the PISP to provide an access token.</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul> <p>Step 4: Confirm Funds (Domestic and International Single Immediate Payments Only)</p> <ul><li>Once the PSU is authenticated and authorised the <strong>payment-order-consent</strong> , the PISP can check whether funds are available to make the payment.</li> <li>This is carried out by making a <strong>GET</strong> request, calling the <strong>funds-confirmation</strong> operator on the <strong>payment-order-consent</strong> resource.</li></ul> <p>Step 5: Create Payment-Order</p> <ul><li>The PISP creates a <strong>payment-order</strong> resource to indicate that the payment created in the steps above should be submitted for processing.</li> <li>This is carried out by making a <strong>POST</strong> request to the appropriate <strong>payment-order</strong> resource.</li> <li>The ASPSP returns the identifier for the payment-order resource to the PISP.</li></ul> <p>Step 6: Get Consent/Payment-Order/Payment-Details Status</p> <ul><li>The PISP can check the status of the payment-order consent (with the ConsentId) or payment-order resource (with the payment-order resource identifier) or payment-details(with the payment-order resource identifier) .</li> <li>This is carried out by making a <strong>GET</strong> request to the <strong>payment-order consent</strong> or <strong>payment-order</strong> or <strong>payment-details</strong> resource.</li></ul> <h4 id="sequence-diagram"><a href="#sequence-diagram" class="header-anchor">#</a> Sequence Diagram</h4> <p><img src="/read-write-api-docs-pub/assets/img/Payments-Flow.afde0dfa.png" alt=""></p> <details><summary>Diagram source</summary> <div class="language- extra-class"><pre class="language-text"><code>participant PSU

These restrictions should be documented on ASPSP developer portals.</p> <p>An ASPSP <strong>must</strong> reject the payment-order <strong>consent</strong> if the ASPSP is unable to handle the request.</p> <h4 id="cutoffdatetime-behaviour"><a href="#cutoffdatetime-behaviour" class="header-anchor">#</a> CutOffDateTime Behaviour</h4> <p>An ASPSP <strong>may</strong> return the specific CutOffDateTime when responding to a payment-order consent request.</p> <p>An ASPSP <strong>must</strong> document the behaviour for a payment receipt before and after the CutOffDateTime for a payment-order has elapsed.</p> <p>Two strategies for handling behaviour are:</p> <ul><li>Reject the payment-order (and steps associated with the creation of payment-order) if received after the applicable CutOffDateTime</li> <li>Accept the payment-order (and steps associated with the creation of payment-order) if received after the applicable CutOffDateTime</li></ul> <h5 id="reject-the-payment-order"><a href="#reject-the-payment-order" class="header-anchor">#</a> Reject the Payment-Order</h5> <p>In this scenario, the behaviour of payment-order execution is explicit to the PISP and PSU.</p> <ul><li>An ASPSP <strong>must</strong> reject the payment-order <strong>consent</strong> if the CutOffDateTime for a specific payment-order type has elapsed.</li> <li>An ASPSP <strong>must</strong> reject an authorization request when the underlying intent object is associated with a CutoffDateTime that has elapsed. The ASPSP <strong>must not</strong> issue an access token in such a situation. The ASPSP <strong>must</strong> set the status of the payment-order consent resource to “Rejected”.</li> <li>An ASPSP <strong>must</strong> reject the payment-order <strong>resource</strong> if the CutOffDateTime for a specific payment-order type, has been established and has elapsed.</li> <li>A PISP <strong>must</strong> ensure that the PSU consent authorisation is completed and the payment-order resource is created before the CutOffDateTime elapses.</li></ul> <p>For a payment-order <strong>consent</strong> or a payment-order <strong>resource</strong> that has been rejected due to the elapsed CutoffDateTime, the PISP <strong>may</strong> decide to create a corresponding schedule payment endpoint to create a new payment-order consent. E.g. if a PISP attempts to make a BACS payment after 16:00, it would be rejected. The PISP may use the /domestic-scheduled-payment-consents endpoint to create a consent for the same payment for the next working day.</p> <h5 id="accept-the-payment-order"><a href="#accept-the-payment-order" class="header-anchor">#</a> Accept the Payment-Order</h5> <p>In this scenario, the behaviour of the payment-order execution is not explicit to the PISP and PSU, and the payment-order will be executed on the next available working day.</p> <ul><li>An ASPSP <strong>must</strong> accept the payment-order <strong>consent</strong> if the CutOffDateTime for a specific payment-order type has elapsed.</li> <li>An ASPSP <strong>must</strong> accept an authorization request when the underlying intent object is associated with a CutoffDateTime that has elapsed.</li> <li>An ASPSP <strong>must</strong> accept the payment-order <strong>resource</strong> if the CutOffDateTime for a specific payment-order type, has been established and has elapsed.</li> <li>An ASPSP <strong>may</strong> update the payment-order consent or payment-order <strong>resource</strong> with the CutOffDateTime, ExpectedExecutionDateTime and ExpectedSettlementDateTime, to communicate expected execution behaviour  if the CutOffDateTime has elapsed.</li></ul> <h3 id="release-management"><a href="#release-management" class="header-anchor">#</a> Release Management</h3> <p>This section overviews the release management and versioning strategy for the Payment Initiation API.

There is no standard method for specifying and enforcing fine-grained scopes e.g., a scope to enforce payments of a specified amount on a specified date.</p> <p>A  <em>consent authorisation</em> is used to define the fine-grained scope that is granted by the PSU to the PISP.</p> <p>The PISP <strong>must</strong> begin a payment-order request by creating a <strong>payment-order consent</strong> resource through a <strong>POST</strong> operation. These resources indicate the  <em>consent</em> that the PISP claims it has been given by the PSU. At this stage, the consent is not yet authorised as the ASPSP has not yet verified this claim with the PSU.</p> <p>The ASPSP responds with a ConsentId. This is the intent-id that is used when initiating the authorization code grant (as described in the Trust Framework).</p> <p>As part of the authorization code grant:</p> <ul><li>The ASPSP authenticates the PSU.</li> <li>The ASPSP plays back the consent (registered by the PISP) back to the PSU to get consent authorisation. The PSU may accept or reject the consent in its entirety (but not selectively).</li> <li>If the consent did not indicate a debtor account the ASPSP presents the PSU with a list of accounts from which the PSU may select one.</li></ul> <p>Once these steps are complete, the consent is considered to have been authorised by the PSU.</p> <h4 id="multiple-authorisation"><a href="#multiple-authorisation" class="header-anchor">#</a> Multiple Authorisation</h4> <p>In a multiple authorisation context, the same consent authorisation steps are followed for the first PSU to authorise or stage the payment-order consent.</p> <p>In the payment-order consent:</p> <ul><li>A PISP <strong>may</strong> request an AuthorisationType for the payment-order (i.e., Single or Any). If a value is not provided, an ASPSP will interpret the AuthorisationType as 'Any'.</li> <li>A PISP <strong>may</strong> request a CompletionDateTime for the payment-order authorisation to be complete. If a value is not provided, an ASPSP will interpret the CompletionDateTime as unbounded.</li> <li>An ASPSP <strong>must</strong> reject the payment-order consent if the AuthorisationType requested by the PISP does not match the DebtorAccount in the request.</li> <li>An ASPSP <strong>must</strong> set the status of the payment-order consent to Rejected, if the AuthorisationType requested by the PISP cannot be satisfied, after PSU Authentication:
<ul><li>The ASPSP must respond back with an OAuth error response fields  <em><strong>error</strong></em> specified as invalid_request and <em><strong>error_description</strong></em> containing an appropriate message.</li></ul></li> <li>An ASPSP <strong>must</strong> restrict the selection of DebtorAccount (in the ASPSP online channel) to accounts that match the AuthorisationType requested by the PISP.</li></ul> <p>In the payment-order resource:</p> <ul><li>An ASPSP <strong>must</strong> respond with the MultiAuthorisation object if the payment-order requires multiple authorisations.
