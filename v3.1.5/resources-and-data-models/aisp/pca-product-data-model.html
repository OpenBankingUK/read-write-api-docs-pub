representative rates (AER for Credit Interest, EAR for overdrafts) would allow a customer to reasonably compare PCA products.</li> <li>PCA Marketing state information is not required.</li> <li>Eligibility criteria met when the PCA was sold is unlikely to be reliable. Hence eligibility criteria information is not required.</li></ul> <p>Further analysis required:-</p> <ul><li>FeaturesAndBenefits: Further analysis is required to check whether the features and benefits section is needed.</li></ul> <h3 id="fields-to-include-in-pca-product"><a href="#fields-to-include-in-pca-product" class="header-anchor">#</a> Fields to include in PCA Product</h3> <table><thead><tr><th>Product Section</th> <th>Fields to be included</th></tr></thead> <tbody><tr><td>PCA (We'll rename this &quot;Product&quot; and merge PCA and CoreProduct attributes)</td> <td><ul><li>Name</li> <li>Open Data Product ID (Mandatory, if product info is available on Open Data PCA API) </li><li>ProductType (&quot;PCA&quot;) </li><li>MonthlyMaximumCharge (Mandatory for &quot;front book&quot; products)</li></ul></td></tr> <tr><td>CoreProduct</td> <td><strong>None</strong> - Will be merged in to new &quot;Product&quot; section.</td></tr> <tr><td>PCAMarketingState</td> <td><strong>None</strong> - Sections will only include current state information, so this section is not required</td></tr> <tr><td>CreditInterest</td> <td><ul><li>TierBandSet fields (excluding credit interest eligibility). </li><li>All TierBand fields <br><strong>Note:</strong> Only current state credit interest information is required.</li></ul></td></tr> <tr><td>Overdraft</td> <td><ul><li> All TierBandSet fields (including OverdraftFeesAndCharges) </li><li> All TierBand fields (including OverdraftFeesAndCharges). <br><strong>Note:</strong> Only current state information is required.</li></ul></td></tr> <tr><td>Eligibility</td> <td><strong>None</strong> - Eligibility criteria met when PCA was sold unlikely to be reliable.</td></tr> <tr><td>FeaturesAndBenefits</td> <td><strong>None</strong> - The value of a particular feature and benefit to an accountholder is dependent on their use of that benefit and whether they met eligibility criteria.
