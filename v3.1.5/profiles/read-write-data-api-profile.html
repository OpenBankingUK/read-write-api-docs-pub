An example is having latitude and longitude in decimal format, as this is how developers will work with latitude and longitude; or using simple types (e.g., a single date-time field) instead of a complex type (e.g., a choice field with a nesting of date and time).</li></ul> <h4 id="extensibility"><a href="#extensibility" class="header-anchor">#</a> Extensibility</h4> <p>It is intended that the API flows will be extended to cater for more complex use-cases in subsequent releases, and we have kept this in mind during the design.</p> <h4 id="idempotency"><a href="#idempotency" class="header-anchor">#</a> Idempotency</h4> <p>Idempotency is difficult to implement consistently and leverage consistently.</p> <p>As a result, idempotency is used sparingly in the Open Banking API specifications; with a preference to allow TPPs to simply re-submit a request under failure conditions.</p> <p>APIs have been defined to be idempotent, where not doing so would cause a poor PSU user-experience or increase false positive risk indicators.</p> <h4 id="message-signing"><a href="#message-signing" class="header-anchor">#</a> Message Signing</h4> <p>Digital signatures will facilitate non-repudiation for Open Banking APIs.</p> <p>The approach for message signing is documented in <a href="#message-signing-1">Basics / Message Signing</a>.</p> <p>The applicability of signatures to individual requests and responses is documented on the page for each of the resources. However, implementers of the standards can <strong>optionally</strong> add signatures to all response and request payloads.</p> <h4 id="message-encryption"><a href="#message-encryption" class="header-anchor">#</a> Message Encryption</h4> <p>Message Encryption is an <strong>optional</strong> feature of the Open Banking APIs to facilitate additional protection of inflight data.</p> <p>The approach for message encryption is documented in <a href="#message-encryption-1">Basics / Message Encryption</a>.</p> <p>Applicability to individual requests and responses is not defined in the standards. Application will be based on agreement between implementors of the standards.</p> <h4 id="agnostic-to-payment-schemes"><a href="#agnostic-to-payment-schemes" class="header-anchor">#</a> Agnostic to Payment Schemes</h4> <p>The API will be designed so that it is agnostic to the underlying payment scheme that is responsible for carrying out the payment.</p> <p>As a result, we will not design field lengths and payloads to only match the Faster Payments message, and will instead rely on the field lengths and definitions in ISO 20022. Due diligence has been carried out to ensure that the API has the necessary fields to function with Bacs payments - as per the agreed scope.</p> <p>We will provide further mapping guidance to ensure that differences are understood between the Open Banking Payment API standard, and FPS and Bacs schemes where applicable.</p> <h4 id="status-codes"><a href="#status-codes" class="header-anchor">#</a> Status Codes</h4> <p>The API uses two status codes that serve two different purposes:</p> <ul><li>The HTTP Status Code reflects the outcome of the API call (the HTTP operation on the resource). Granular Functional Error Codes are specified as part of API <a href="#error-response-structure">Error Response Structure</a>, after consultation with Security and Fraud Working Group.</li> <li>A Status field in some of the resource payloads reflects the status of resources.</li></ul> <h4 id="unique-identifiers-id-fields"><a href="#unique-identifiers-id-fields" class="header-anchor">#</a> Unique Identifiers (Id Fields)</h4> <p>A REST resource should have a unique identifier (e.g. a primary key) that may be used to identify the resource. These unique identifiers are used to construct URLs to identify and address specific resources.</p> <p>However, considering that some of the resources described in these specifications do not have a primary key in the system of record, the Id field will be optional for some resources.</p> <p>An ASPSP that chooses to populate optional Id fields must ensure that the values are unique and immutable.</p> <h4 id="categorisation-of-implementation-requirements"><a href="#categorisation-of-implementation-requirements" class="header-anchor">#</a> Categorisation of Implementation Requirements</h4> <p>Where a requirement is being implemented by either an ASPSP and/or a TPP, a different categorisation is applied. The functionality, endpoints and fields within each resource are categorised as 'Mandatory', 'Conditional' or 'Optional'.</p> <p>ASPSPs <strong>must</strong> make documentation available to TPPs (e.g. on their developer portals) to which 'Conditional' / 'Optional' endpoints and fields are implemented for any given implementation of the specification.</p> <h5 id="mandatory"><a href="#mandatory" class="header-anchor">#</a> Mandatory</h5> <p>Functionality, endpoints and fields marked as Mandatory are required in all cases for regulatory compliance and/or for the API to function and deliver essential customer outcomes.</p> <p>For functionalities and endpoints:</p> <ul><li>An ASPSP <strong>must</strong> implement an endpoint that is marked Mandatory.</li> <li>An ASPSP <strong>must</strong> implement functionality that is marked Mandatory.</li></ul> <p>For fields:</p> <ul><li>A TPP <strong>must</strong> specify the value of a Mandatory field.</li> <li>An ASPSP <strong>must</strong> process a Mandatory field when provided by the TPP in an API request.</li> <li>An ASPSP <strong>must</strong> include meaningful values for Mandatory fields in an API response.</li></ul> <h5 id="conditional"><a href="#conditional" class="header-anchor">#</a> Conditional</h5> <p>Functionality, endpoints and fields marked as Conditional may be required in some cases for regulatory compliance (for example, if these are made available to the PSU in the ASPSP's existing Online Channel, or if ASPSPs (or a subset of ASPSPs) have been mandated by a regulatory requirement).</p> <p>For functionalities and endpoints:</p> <ul><li>An ASPSP <strong>must</strong> implement functionality and endpoints marked as Conditional if these are required for regulatory compliance.</li></ul> <p>For fields:</p> <ul><li>All fields that are not marked as Mandatory are Conditional.</li> <li>A TPP <strong>may</strong> specify the value of a Conditional field.</li> <li>An ASPSP <strong>must</strong> process a Conditional field when provided by the TPP in an API request, and <strong>must</strong> respond with an error if it cannot support a particular value of a Conditional field.</li> <li>An ASPSP <strong>must</strong> include meaningful values for Conditional fields in an API response if these are required for regulatory compliance.</li></ul> <h5 id="optional"><a href="#optional" class="header-anchor">#</a> Optional</h5> <p>Functionality and endpoints marked as Optional are not necessarily required for regulatory compliance but may be implemented to enable desired customer outcomes.</p> <p>For functionalities and endpoints:</p> <ul><li>An ASPSP <strong>may</strong> implement an Optional endpoint.</li> <li>An ASPSP <strong>may</strong> implement Optional functionality.</li></ul> <p>For fields:</p> <ul><li>There are no Optional fields.</li> <li>For any endpoints which are implemented by an ASPSP, the fields are either Mandatory or Conditional.</li></ul> <h2 id="basics"><a href="#basics"

The intent-id can then be used as a proxy to identify the PSU.</p> <p>In order to carry out re-authentication, the TPP can take a PSU through SCA in the context of the consent that is to be re-authenticated.</p> <p>The TPP should then call the ASPSP's token end-point with a grant type of <code>urn:ietf:params:oauth:grant-type:jwt-bearer</code> as defined in RFC 7523.</p> <p>The TPP must follow the following additional criteria for the JWT header:</p> <ul><li>Set the <code>alg</code> of the JWS header to PS256</li> <li>Specify the <code>kid</code> of the signing key in the JWS header.

The TPP may use the claim <code>vot</code> to pass in vectors of trust that provides a description of the sca applied.</p> <p>ASPSPs that require the <code>vot</code> claim to be included in the jwt-bearer should document the required details on their developer portal.</p> <h5 id="example"><a href="#example" class="header-anchor">#</a> Example</h5> <p>The following is a non-normative example of a call made to a token end-point to initiate a jwt-bearer grant</p> <div class="language- extra-class"><pre class="language-text"><code>POST /token HTTP/1.1
