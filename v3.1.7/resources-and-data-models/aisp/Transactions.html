As an &quot;unstated&quot; standard, a transaction with a status of <code>Pending</code> was considered to be mutable (ie some of its fields like date, description and amount may change or the transaction may be backed out completely) while a <code>Booked</code> transaction was considered to be immutable. There were however, some edge cases where a <code>Booked</code> transaction may suffer from changes to some fields.</p> <p>Since Version 3.1.5, the mutability for a transaction has been made explicit:</p> <ul><li>A transaction with a <code>Status</code> of <code>Pending</code> is mutable</li> <li>A transaction with a <code>Status</code> of <code>Booked</code> where the <code>TransactionMutability</code> flag is not specified is immutable.</li> <li>A transaction with a <code>Status</code> of <code>Booked</code> with the <code>TransactionMutability</code> flag set to <code>Immutable</code> is immutable.</li> <li>A transaction with a <code>Status</code> of <code>Booked</code> with the <code>TransactionMutability</code> flag set to <code>Mutable</code> is mutable.</li></ul> <h4 id="examples-to-illustrate-mutability"><a href="#examples-to-illustrate-mutability" class="header-anchor">#</a> Examples to illustrate mutability</h4> <div class="language- extra-class"><pre class="language-text"><code>// Mutable ( Status is Pending )
