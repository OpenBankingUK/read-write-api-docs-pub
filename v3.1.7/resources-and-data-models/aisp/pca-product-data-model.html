(on-sale, negotiated or back book).</li> <li>The MMC is the CMA's attempt to come up with a core fee/charge that can be used for PCA product comparison purposes.</li> <li>This, in combination, with representative rates (AER for Credit Interest, EAR for overdrafts) would allow a customer to reasonably compare PCA products.</li> <li>PCA Marketing state information is not required.</li> <li>Eligibility criteria met when the PCA was sold is unlikely to be reliable. Hence eligibility criteria information is not required.</li></ul> <p>Further analysis required:-</p> <ul><li>FeaturesAndBenefits: Further analysis is required to check whether the features and benefits section is needed.</li></ul> <h3 id="fields-to-include-in-pca-product"><a href="#fields-to-include-in-pca-product" class="header-anchor">#</a> Fields to include in PCA Product</h3> <table><thead><tr><th>Product Section</th> <th>Fields to be included</th></tr></thead> <tbody><tr><td>PCA (We'll rename this &quot;Product&quot; and merge PCA and CoreProduct attributes)</td> <td><ul><li>Name</li> <li>Open Data Product ID (Mandatory, if product info is available on Open Data PCA API) </li><li>ProductType (&quot;PCA&quot;) </li><li>MonthlyMaximumCharge (Mandatory for &quot;front book&quot; products)</li></ul></td></tr> <tr><td>CoreProduct</td> <td><strong>None</strong> - Will be merged in to new &quot;Product&quot; section.</td></tr> <tr><td>PCAMarketingState</td> <td><strong>None</strong> - Sections will only include current state information, so this section is not required</td></tr> <tr><td>CreditInterest</td> <td><ul><li>TierBandSet fields (excluding credit interest eligibility). </li><li>All TierBand fields <br><strong>Note:</strong> Only current state credit interest information is required.</li></ul></td></tr> <tr><td>Overdraft</td> <td><ul><li> All TierBandSet fields (including OverdraftFeesAndCharges) </li><li> All TierBand fields (including OverdraftFeesAndCharges). <br><strong>Note:</strong> Only current state information is required.</li></ul></td></tr> <tr><td>Eligibility</td> <td><strong>None</strong> - Eligibility criteria met when PCA was sold unlikely to be reliable.</td></tr> <tr><td>FeaturesAndBenefits</td> <td><strong>None</strong> - The value of a particular feature and benefit to an accountholder is dependent on their use of that benefit and whether they met eligibility criteria.

alt=" PCAHighLevel.ClassDiagram.png "></p> <h4 id="credit-interest-model"><a href="#credit-interest-model" class="header-anchor">#</a> Credit Interest Model</h4> <ul><li>AER is the only representative rate for CreditInterest for product comparison purposes and therefore has been explicitly captured.</li> <li>The banks often also specify Gross rates. Net is usually determined by removing basic rate tax only, and banks stopped doing this from April 2016. This may still be required for backbook products.</li> <li>It has been ensured that both the calculation and application frequency for credit interest is captured.
<ul><li>The term &quot;Nominal&quot; used by some banks is synonymous with &quot;Gross&quot;.</li></ul></li> <li>DepositInterestAppliedCoverage refers to which interest rate is applied when interests are tiered. For example, if an account balance is £2k and the interest tiers are:- 0-£500 0.1%, 500-1000 0.2%, 1000-10000 0.5%, then the applicable interest rate could either be 0.5% of the entire balance (since the account balance sits in the top interest tier) or (0.1%*500)+(0.2%*500)+(0.5%*1000). In the 1st situation, the interest should be applied to the &quot;Whole&quot; of the account balance and in the 2nd, this should be &quot;Tiered&quot;.</li> <li>Destination refers to whether the Product allows interest to be credited to another account (&quot;PayAway&quot;) or only to itself (&quot;SelfCredit&quot;).</li></ul> <p><img src="/read-write-api-docs-pub/assets/img/PCACreditInterestClassDiagram.c211ea43.png" alt=" images/PCA/PCACreditInterestClassDiagram.png "></p> <h4 id="overdraft"><a href="#overdraft" class="header-anchor">#</a> Overdraft</h4> <ul><li>Overdraft Types can either be committed: The banks are committed to provide this overdraft facility and cannot demand repayment without notifying the customer, or OnDemand : The bank can demand instant repayment of this overdraft.</li> <li>Student Account: Can it be negotiated or back book product?</li> <li>OverdraftFeeCharges are defined at TierBandSet level for fees/charges that are not tiered and at the TierBand level for those that are.</li></ul> <p><img src="/read-write-api-docs-pub/assets/img/PCAOverdraftClassDiagram.2c709009.png" alt=" PCAOverdraftClassDiagram.png "></p> <h4 id="overdraftfeecharges"><a href="#overdraftfeecharges" class="header-anchor">#</a> OverdraftFeeCharges</h4> <ul><li>A cap can be applied to 1 or more Overdraft Fees/Charges and are typically capped for a particular period e.g. Total overdraft charges (Arranged, Unarranged, Paid Transaction, Unpaid Transaction) may be capped on a monthly basis.
