id="overview"><a href="#overview" class="header-anchor">#</a> Overview</h2> <p>The Payment Initiation API Profile describes the flows and common functionality for the Payment Initiation API, which

payment-order
<ul><li>Domestic immediate, international immediate and international scheduled (immediate debit) payments only.</li></ul></li> <li>Subsequently <strong>submit</strong> the payment-order for processing.</li> <li>Optionally retrieve the status of a payment-order <strong>consent</strong> or payment-order <strong>resource</strong>.</li></ul> <p>This profile should be read in conjunction with a compatible Read/Write Data API Profile which provides a description of the elements that are common across all the Read/Write Data APIs, and compatible individual resources.</p> <h3 id="document-overview"><a href="#document-overview" class="header-anchor">#</a> Document Overview</h3> <p>This document consists of the following parts:</p> <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Provides an overview of the profile.</p> <p><strong>Basics:</strong> Identifies the flows, restrictions and release management.</p> <p><strong>Security &amp; Access Control:</strong> Specifies the means for PISPs and PSUs to authenticate themselves and provide consent.</p> <p><strong>Data Model:</strong> Documents mappings and enumerations that apply to all the end-points.</p> <p><strong>Alternative Flows:</strong> Documents rules for alternative flows.</p> <h3 id="resources"><a href="#resources" class="header-anchor">#</a> Resources</h3> <p>Each of the Payment Initiation API resources are documented in the  <a href="/read-write-api-docs-pub/v3.1.7/resources-and-data-models/pisp/">Resources and Data Models/PISP</a> area of the specification. Each resource is documented with:</p> <ul><li>Endpoints

<ul><li>Resource definition.</li> <li>UML diagram.</li> <li>Permissions as they relate to accessing the resource.</li> <li>Data dictionary - which defines fields, re-usable classes, mandatory (1..1) or conditional (0..1) as defined in the Design Principles section, and enumerations.</li></ul></li> <li>Usage Examples</li></ul> <h3 id="design-principles"><a href="#design-principles" class="header-anchor">#</a> Design Principles</h3> <h4 id="scheme-agnostic"><a href="#scheme-agnostic" class="header-anchor">#</a> Scheme Agnostic</h4> <p>The API has been be designed so that it is agnostic to the underlying payment scheme that is responsible for carrying out the payment.</p> <p>In doing so, this means we will not design field lengths and payloads to only match the Faster Payments message, and will instead rely on the field lengths and definitions in ISO 20022. Due diligence has been carried out to ensure that the API has the necessary fields to function with Bacs payments as per the agreed scope.</p> <p>Further mapping guidance has been provided to ensure that differences are understood between the Open Banking Payment API standard, and other message formats in the Domestic Payment Message Formats sub-page.</p> <h4 id="status-codes"><a href="#status-codes" class="header-anchor">#</a> Status Codes</h4> <p>The API uses two status codes that serve two different purposes:</p> <ul><li>The HTTP Status Code reflects the outcome of the API call (the HTTP operation on the resource).</li> <li>The Status field for the payment-order consent reflects the status of the PSU consent authorisation.</li> <li>The Status field for the payment-order resource reflects the status of the payment-order initiation or execution.</li></ul> <h2 id="basics"><a href="#basics" class="header-anchor">#</a> Basics</h2> <h3 id="overview-2"><a href="#overview-2" class="header-anchor">#</a> Overview</h3> <p>The figure below provides a <strong>general</strong> outline of a payment flow for all payment-order types using the Payment APIs. The payment-order types covered in this profile include:</p> <ul><li>Domestic payments.</li> <li>Domestic scheduled payments.</li> <li>Domestic standing orders.</li> <li>International payments.</li> <li>International scheduled payments.</li></ul> <p>The payment-order consent and payment-order resource in the following flow generalises for the different payment-order types. e.g. for a domestic payment, the payment-order consent resource is domestic-payment-consents; and the payment-order resource is domestic-payments.</p> <p><img src="/read-write-api-docs-pub/assets/img/PaymentStatusModelTriangle.15d76462.png" alt="Payments Flow"></p> <h4 id="steps"><a href="#steps" class="header-anchor">#</a> Steps</h4> <p>Step 1: Agree Payment-Order Initiation</p> <ul><li>This flow begins with a PSU consenting to a payment being made. The consent is between the PSU and the PISP.</li> <li>The debtor account details can optionally be specified at this stage.</li></ul> <p>Step 2: Setup Payment-Order Consent</p> <ul><li>The PISP connects to the ASPSP that services the PSU's payment account and creates a new <strong>payment-order consent</strong> resource. This informs the ASPSP that one of its PSUs intends to make a <strong>payment-order</strong>. The ASPSP responds with an identifier for the payment-order consent resource (the ConsentId, which is the intent identifier).</li> <li>This step is carried out by making a <strong>POST</strong> request to the <strong>payment-order consent</strong> resource.</li></ul> <p>Step 3: Authorise Consent</p> <ul><li>The PISP requests the PSU to authorise the consent. The ASPSP may carry this out by using a <em>redirection flow</em> or a <em>decoupled flow</em>.
<ul><li>In a redirection flow, the PISP redirects the PSU to the ASPSP.
<ul><li>The redirect includes the ConsentId generated in the previous step.</li> <li>This allows the ASPSP to correlate the payment order consent that was setup.</li> <li>The ASPSP authenticates the PSU.</li> <li>The PSU selects the debtor account at this stage (if it has not been previously specified in Step 1).</li> <li>The ASPSP updates the state of the payment order consent resource internally to indicate that the consent has been authorised.</li> <li>Once the consent has been authorised, the PSU is redirected back to the PISP.</li></ul></li> <li>In a decoupled flow, the ASPSP requests the PSU to authorise consent on an  <em>authentication device</em> that is separate from the  <em>consumption device</em> on which the PSU is interacting with the PISP.
<ul><li>The decoupled flow is initiated by the PISP calling a back-channel authorisation request.</li> <li>The request contains a 'hint' that identifies the PSU paired with the consent to be authorised.</li> <li>The ASPSP authenticates the PSU</li> <li>The PSU selects the debtor account at this stage (if it has not been previously specified in Step 1)</li> <li>The ASPSP updates the state of the payment order consent resource internally to indicate that the consent has been authorised.</li> <li>Once the consent has been authorised, the ASPSP can make a callback to the PISP to provide an access token.</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul> <p>Step 4: Confirm Funds (Domestic and International Single Immediate Payments Only)</p> <ul><li>Once the PSU is authenticated and authorised the <strong>payment-order-consent</strong> , the PISP can check whether funds are available to make the payment.</li> <li>This is carried out by making a <strong>GET</strong> request, calling the <strong>funds-confirmation</strong> operator on the <strong>payment-order-consent</strong> resource.</li></ul> <p>Step 5: Create Payment-Order</p> <ul><li>The PISP creates a <strong>payment-order</strong> resource to indicate that the payment created in the steps above should be submitted for processing.</li> <li>This is carried out by making a <strong>POST</strong> request to the appropriate <strong>payment-order</strong> resource.</li> <li>The ASPSP returns the identifier for the payment-order resource to the PISP.</li></ul> <p>Step 6: Get Consent/Payment-Order/Payment-Details Status</p> <ul><li>The PISP can check the status of the payment-order consent (with the ConsentId) or payment-order resource (with the payment-order resource identifier) or payment-details(with the payment-order resource identifier) .</li> <li>This is carried out by making a <strong>GET</strong> request to the <strong>payment-order consent</strong> or <strong>payment-order</strong> or <strong>payment-details</strong> resource.</li></ul> <h4 id="sequence-diagram"><a href="#sequence-diagram" class="header-anchor">#</a> Sequence Diagram</h4> <p><img src="/read-write-api-docs-pub/assets/img/Payments-Flow.afde0dfa.png" alt=""></p> <details><summary>Diagram source</summary> <div class="language- extra-class"><pre class="language-text"><code>participant PSU
