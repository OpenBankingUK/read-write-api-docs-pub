Where time elements do not exist in ASPSP systems, the time portion of the DateTime element will be defaulted to 00:00:00+00:00.</li> <li>The BookingDateTime has been set to mandatory as all ASPSPs must provide this field for pagination and filtering. The BookingDateTime is the date the transaction is booked (or posted) and becomes immutable, which is not the date the transaction took place.</li> <li>Either the BankTransactionCode (which is the ISO transaction code list), <strong>or</strong> ProprietaryBankTransactionCode, <strong>or</strong> <strong>both</strong> may be populated. While the expectation is that at least one of BankTransactionCode. or ProprietaryBankTransactionCode are populated, we have decided not to enforce this behaviour in the payload structure as this would require nesting elements and introducing complex choice elements.</li> <li>The BankTransactionCode (ISO) code-list is documented on the ISO20022 website: https://www.iso20022.org/external_code_list.page; and External Code Sets spreadsheet.
<ul><li>The ISO 20022 BankTransactionCode Code and SubCode are specified as 4 letter codes. However, the principle we have applied for the code lists is to have longer more descriptive codes.</li> <li>The BankTransactionCode Code and SubCode will be populated with the long form description of the ISO 20022 code, with delimiters removed. E.g., the Family Code &quot;CNTR&quot; has a description of &quot;Counter Transactions&quot; which is populated as &quot;CounterTransactions&quot;</li></ul></li> <li>ASPSPs must have the ability to provide transactions through APIs for a period that at least equals the period provided through their online channels.</li></ul> <h3 id="filtering"><a href="#filtering" class="header-anchor">#</a> Filtering</h3> <p>Limited support for filtering is provided on the  <strong>transactions</strong>  resource.</p> <table><thead><tr><th>Name</th> <th>Occurrence</th> <th>Enhanced Definition</th> <th>Class</th></tr></thead> <tbody><tr><td>fromBookingDateTime</td> <td>0..1</td> <td>Specifies start date and time for filtering of the Transaction records on the Transaction/BookingDateTime field</td> <td>ISODateTime</td></tr> <tr><td>toBookingDateTime</td> <td>0..1</td> <td>Specifies end date and time for filtering of the Transaction records on the Transaction/BookingDateTime field.</td> <td>ISODateTime</td></tr></tbody></table> <p>The ASPSP must treat the following as valid input:</p> <ul><li>Non-working days (e.g. a Sunday or a Bank holiday) or any other days on which no transactions are recorded.</li> <li>Dates that fall outside the range for which transaction information is provided through APIs.</li> <li>Dates that fall outside the range for which a consent authorisation is available.</li> <li>Timezone may be included in the filter request, but must be ignored by the ASPSP.</li></ul> <p>In the above situations, the ASPSP must return data for the remaining valid period specified by the filter.</p> <h4 id="filtering-examples"><a href="#filtering-examples" class="header-anchor">#</a> Filtering Examples</h4> <div class="language- extra-class"><pre class="language-text"><code>// All transactions from 1st Jan, 2015
