The comparison included the following Fee Types(Please see the attached codelist file), which we think are relevant, all of which are domestic transactions. As well as fee comparison information provided by the banks to the CMA9, there are tariff comparison calculators provided by some of the banks that allow a BCA holder the ability to determine which bank product would provide them with the lowest set of charges.</li> <li><strong>Electronic:</strong> Auto credit, Bill payment, Debit card payment, Direct debit, Standing Order</li> <li><strong>Branch/Other:</strong> Pay in (Counter), Deposit (Cheque), Issue (Cheque), Withdrawal (Counter), Cash In, Cash Out (Counter), Cash Out (ATM)</li> <li>However, our analysis is that the basket of fees is a weighted average provided as a one-off activity and it would be difficult for the banks to supply fees/charges for these business activities in a real time API. This is due to banks charging fees at different levels of granularity today and fee standardisation being required. Although comparative pricing is highlighted as a key driver of the Open Banking initiative, without fee standardisation, the complexity of comparing fees is likely to deter customers from considering switching.</li> <li><strong>We conclude, that as with BCA, the periodic fee is the most common &quot;Other&quot; fee and charge that BCA price comparison websites provide today.</strong></li> <li>Banks will provide the Open Data Product ID.</li> <li>In addition to the &quot;Open Data Product ID&quot; link, we should focus on fields that are provided by price comparison websites today.

alt=" BCATopLevel.ClassDiagram.png "></p> <h4 id="creditinterest-model"><a href="#creditinterest-model" class="header-anchor">#</a> CreditInterest Model</h4> <ul><li>AER is the only representative rate for CreditInterest for product comparison purposes and therefore has been explicitly captured.</li> <li>The banks often also specify Gross rates. Net is usually determined by removing basic rate tax only, and banks stopped doing this from April 2016. This may still be required for backbook products.</li> <li>It has been ensured that both the calculation and application frequency for credit interest is captured.</li> <li>The term &quot;Nominal&quot; used by some banks is synonymous with &quot;Gross&quot;.</li> <li>DepositInterestAppliedCoverage refers to which interest rate is applied when interests are tiered. For example, if an account balance is £2k and the interest tiers are:- 0-£500 0.1%, 500-1000 0.2%, 1000-10000 0.5%, then the applicable interest rate could either be 0.5% of the entire balance (since the account balance sits in the top interest tier) or (0.1%*500)+(0.2%*500)+(0.5%*1000).
