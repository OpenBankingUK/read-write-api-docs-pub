## Overview

The specification defines certain fields with only a fixed set of possible values as enumerations, and further additions to possible values require a Specification change.

As part of Version 3 Open Banking Specifications defined new custom Data Types, which are an extendable list of enumerated values. Any extensions to this standard list of values can be done by the ASPSPs, with relevant documentation on their Developer Portals.

The extendable Data Type values are namespaced, to help identify the issuer of the value, and the relevant value.

## Basics

These Data Types, in general, are called namespaced enumerations.

Specific API Data Dictionary will define a custom Data Type class, which will help lookup the OBL defined standard set of namespaced enumerations in this specification page as well as respective swagger files.

The namespaced enumeration values specified by Open Banking are documented here and will be prefixed by `UK.OB.`

### Design Principles

When extending a namespaced enumeration:
* ASPSPs **must not** publish an ASPSP-specific enumerated value where a generic OBL defined enumerated value may be used.
* ASPSPs **must** place such values in a namespace consisting of their two-letter country code (ISO 3166-1 Alpha-2 code), followed by a full-stop, followed by their name. e.g.
  *  UK.Barclays.PingIt
  *  KE.Safaricom.M-Pesa

### Release Management

Usage of non-namespaced values may be discontinued in a future version of this standard.

As a special case and in order to minimise disruption between versions of the standard, a TPP **may** specify previous non-namespaces values, e.g. IBAN instead of UK.OB.IBAN.

In ASPSP generated responses, however, an ASPSP **must** always respond with fully namespaced values.

## Common Namespaced Enumerations

The following namespaced enumerations are used across all the standards.

### OBExternalAccountIdentification4Code

This is Data Type for Account/SchemeName and used to identify the type of Identification used to identify an account.

| UK.OB.Wallet |A primary and unique account identifier used to identify a wallet.<br>An ASPSP must document on their developer portal, the payment methods that supports this account identifier. |


### OBExternalFinancialInstitutionIdentification4Code
