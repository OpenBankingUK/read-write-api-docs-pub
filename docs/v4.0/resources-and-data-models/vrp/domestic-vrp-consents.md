## Overview

The Domestic VRP Consents resource is used by a TPP to register a consent to initiate one or more of domestic payments within the control parameters agreed with the PSU.

This resource description should be read in conjunction with a compatible Variable Recurring Payments API Profile.

The PISP must call the end-point with the appropriate scope that they have been assigned.
The ASPSP may use the scope to limit to functionality to sweeping or non-sweeping usage of the VRP.

### POST /domestic-vrp-consents

The API endpoint allows the TPP to ask an ASPSP to create a new `domestic-vrp-consents` resource.

The request payload may contain Debtor Accounts, but the PSU may not have been identified by the ASPSP.

The endpoint allows the TPP to send a copy of the consent (between PSU and TPP) to the ASPSP for the PSU to authorise.

The ASPSP creates the resource and responds with a unique ConsentId to refer to the resource.

The default/initial Status of the resource is set to `AWAU`.

If the parameters specified by the TPP in this resource are not valid, or fail any rules, the ASPSP must return a 400 Bad Request. In such a situation a resource is not created.

The ASPSP **must** allow a PSU to have multiple VRP consents for a given account. This could include multiple consents with the same PISP.

The ASPSP **must** reject a consent request that has `Data.ControlParameters.SupplementaryData` that it cannot process.

Remittance Information __MAY__ be provided in the Initiation section when a VRP Consent is setup. This means the same Remittance Information __MUST__ be provided by the PISP in the Initiation and Instruction section of each VRP Payment.

An ASPSP may choose to support Dynamic references for VRP, in which case the following guidance should be used:
If each VRP Payment requires dynamic Remittance Information for each VRP Payment then the Remittance Information at the VRP Consent level __MUST NOT__ be captured.
The Remittance Information in the Initiation section provided at the VRP Payment level __MUST__ match the Initiation section provided at the VRP Consent level.

Examples:

| Remittance Information | Initiation section<br>(VRP Consent) | Initiation section<br>(VRP Payment) | Instruction section<br>(VRP Payment) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Creditor Information/Reference | Credit Card No | Credit Card No| Credit Card No |
| Creditor Information/Reference | Empty | Empty | Dynamic reference for each payment |
| Creditor Information/Reference | Empty | Empty | Dynamic Invoice number for each payment |




### GET /domestic-vrp-consents/{ConsentId}

A TPP can retrieve a VRP consent resource that they have created to check its status at any point of time using this API.

### DELETE /domestic-vrp-consents/{ConsentId}

A TPP can delete a VRP consent resource that they have created by calling this API.

### POST /domestic-vrp-consents/{ConsentId}/funds-confirmation

This API endpoint allows the TPP to ask an ASPSP to confirm funds on the `DebtorAccount` associated with the `domestic-vrp-consent`.

An ASPSP can only respond to a funds confirmation request if the resource has a Status of `AUTH`.

If resource has any other Status, the ASPSP must respond with a 400 (Bad Request) and a `U009` (UK.OBIE.Resource.InvalidConsentStatus) error code.

### PUT /domestic-vrp-consents/{consentId}
This endpoint is only used for migration of consent data across API Standard versions. The ASPSP can choose to implement one or both of the PUT/PATCH endpoints and TPPs should refer to the ASPSP developer portal for information on availability.    

This endpoint should not be used to modify content of an existing consent created on the same version.  The ASPSP __must__ reject request if a TPP attempts to modify an existing resource which does not require migration to the new format.

The request body should contain the correct schema for the current version of the API specification with any associated enumeration values that have moved to short code format.  Values originally supplied in the consent such as account information, control parameters, dates or monetary values __must not__ change and the ASPSP __must__ reject any requests which modify these values.

Successful submission must return the updated consent resource body.

### PATCH /domestic-vrp-consents/{consentId}
This endpoint is only used for migration of consent data across Standard versions. The ASPSP can choose to implement one or both of the PUT/PATCH endpoints and TPPs should refer to the ASPSP developer portal for information on availability.    

This endpoint should not be used to modify content of an existing consent created on the same version.  The ASPSP __must__ reject request if a TPP attempts to modify an existing resource which does not require migration to the new format.

The request body should contain an array of JSON Patch operations, as per [RFC 6902](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6902), adressing only the changed schema and any associated enumeration values that have moved to short code format, matching the current API specification.  Values originally supplied in the consent such as account information, control parameters, dates or monetary values __must not__ change and the ASPSP __must__ reject any requests which modify these values.

PATCH operations are atomic, all requested changes are successfully applied or none are. Errors should reflect the underlying cause and indicate which field caused the failure if relevant.

The following examples shows a series of patch operations that updates the ContractPresentIndicator field name and updates the AddressType value to the ISO code value.
``` json
[
 { "op": "remove", "path": "/Risk/ContractPresentInidicator" },
 { "op": "add", "path": "/Risk/ContractPresentIndicator", "value": "true" },
 { "op": "replace", "path": "/Data/Initiation/CreditorPostalAddress/AddressType", "value": "HOME" }
 { "op": "replace", "path": "/Risk/DeliveryAddress/AddressType", "value": "HOME" }
]
```

Successful submission must return the full updated consent resource body.



## State Model - VRP consents

The state model for the VRP consents resource follows the generic consent state model. However, it does not use the `COND` Status.

![VRP Consent State model](./images/PIS-VRP_PO_Consent.png)


All `domestic-vrp-consents` start off with a Status of `AWAU`

Once the PSU authorises the resource - the StausCode will be set to `AUTH`.

If the PSU rejects the consent, the StautsCode will be set to `RJCT`.

The available status codes for the VRP consents resource are:

- AWAU
- RJCT
- AUTH
- CANC
- EXPD

The definitions for the Status:

|     | Status                |  Description                                                            |
|-----|-----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1   | AWAU | The consent resource is awaiting PSU authorisation.                           |
| 2   | RJCT              | The consent resource has been rejected.                                       |
| 3   | AUTH            | The consent resource has been successfully authorised.  
| 4| CANC| The consent resource has been canceled.                      |
| 5| EXPD| The consent resource has expired.|


Changes to the Status, such as being rejected, should be captured in `StatusReason`, an array of `StatusReasonCode`, `StatusReasonDescription` and `Path`.  

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| StatusReasonCode | Code directly relating to the reason for the current Status. See `OBExternalStatusReason1Code` in [OB_Internal_CodeSet](https://github.com/OpenBankingUK/External_internal_CodeSets) for appropriate values. |
| StatusReasonDescription | Description of why the code was returned |
|Path| Path is optional but relevant when the status reason refers to an object/field and hence conditional to provide JSON path. |
