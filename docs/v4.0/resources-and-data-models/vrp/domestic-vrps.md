## Overview

The Domestic VRPs resource is used by a TPP to initiate a domestic payment, under an authorised VRP Consent.

This resource description should be read in conjunction with a compatible Payment Initiation API Profile.

## Endpoints

| Resource |HTTP Operation |Endpoint |Mandatory |Scope |Grant Type |Message Signing |Idempotency Key |Request Object |Response Object |
| -------- |-------------- |-------- |----------- |----- |---------- |--------------- |--------------- |-------------- |--------------- |
| domestic-vrps |POST |POST /domestic-vrps | Conditional |payments |Authorization Code |Signed Request Signed Response |Yes | OBDomesticVRPRequest |OBDomesticVRPResponse |
| domestic-vrps |GET |GET /domestic-vrps/{DomesticVRPId} | Conditional |payments |Client Credentials |Signed Response |No |NA |OBDomesticVRPResponse |
| domestic-vrps |GET |GET /domestic-vrps/{DomesticVRPId}/payment-details | Optional |payments |Client Credentials |Signed Response |No |NA |OBDomesticVRPDetails |

### POST /domestic-vrps

Once a `domestic-vrp-consents` has been authorised by the PSU, the TPP can proceed to submitting a `domestic-vrps` for processing.

This is done by making a POST request to the `domestic-vrps` endpoint.

This request is an instruction to the ASPSP to begin the domestic single immediate payment journey. The domestic payment must be executed immediately, however, there are some scenarios where the domestic payment may not be executed immediately (e.g., busy periods at the ASPSP).

The TPP **must** ensure that the `Initiation` and `Risk` section matches the values specified in the consent.

The ASPSP **must** ensure that the payment instruction adheres to the limitations set by the corresponding VRP consent's `ControlParameters`.

When a payment would breach a limitation set by one or more `ControlParameters`, the ASPSP **must** return an error with code `U014` and pass in the control parameter field that caused the error in the `Field` field of the error message.

If the `CreditorAccount` was not specified in the the consent, the `CreditorAccount` must be specified in the instruction.

The TPP **must** ensure that the end-point is called with the same scope as the one used for the corresponding consent.

The ASPSP **must** reject a payment that has `Data.Instruction.SupplementaryData` that it cannot process.

#### Status

A `domestic-vrps` can only be created if its corresponding `domestic-vrp-consents` resource has the Status of `AUTH`.

The `domestic-vrps` resource that is created successfully must have one of the following `PaymentStatusCode` values

| Status |
| ------ |
| RCVD |
| PDNG |
| ACTC |
| RJCT |

### GET /domestic-vrps/{DomesticVRPId}

Once the domestic vrp is created, a TPP can retrieve the `domestic-vrps` to check its status by using this endpoint.

The domestic-vrp resource must have one of the following ExternalPaymentTransactionStatus1Code code-set enumerations (for more information see `ExternalPaymentTransactionStatus1Code` [here](https://github.com/OpenBankingUK/External_internal_CodeSets)) :

| Status |
| ------ |
| PDNG |
| ACTC |
| PATC |
| ACCP |
| ACFC |
| ACSP |
| ACWC |
| ACSC |
| ACWP |
| ACCC |
| BLCK |
| RJCT |
| RCVD |

### GET /domestic-vrps/{DomesticVRPId}/payment-details

A TPP can retrieve the details of the underlying payment transaction via this endpoint. This resource allows ASPSPs to return a richer list of Payment Statuses, and if available payment scheme related statuses.

The API must return one of the following status codes:

| Status |
| ------ |
| RCVD |
| PDNG |
| ACTC |
| ACCP |
| ACFC |
| ACSP |
| ACWC |
| ACSC |
| ACWP |
| ACCC |
| BLCK |
| RJCT |

## State Model

### Payment Order

The state model for the `domestic-vrps` resource follows the behavior and definitions for the ISO 20022 PaymentStatusCode code-set.

__Note: Multi-authorisation is not currently supported in VRP.__

__Payment order state model key:__
| Colour (Style) | Description |
