## Overview

The Domestic Standing Order Consent resource is used by a PISP to register an intent to initiate a Domestic Standing Order.

This resource description should be read in conjunction with a compatible Payment Initiation API Profile.

## Endpoints

| Resource |HTTP Operation |Endpoint |Mandatory ? |Scope |Grant Type |Message Signing |Idempotency Key |Request Object |Response Object |
| -------- |-------------- |-------- |----------- |----- |---------- |--------------- |--------------- |-------------- |--------------- |
| domestic-standing-order-consents |POST |POST /domestic-standing-order-consents |Conditional |payments |Client Credentials |Signed Request Signed Response |Yes |OBWriteDomesticStandingOrderConsent5 |OBWriteDomesticStandingOrderConsentResponse6 |
| domestic-standing-order-consents |GET |GET /domestic-standing-order-consents/{ConsentId} |Mandatory (if resource POST implemented) |payments |Client Credentials |Signed Response |No |NA |OBWriteDomesticStandingOrderConsentResponse6 |

### POST /domestic-standing-order-consents

The API endpoint allows the PISP to ask an ASPSP to create a new **domestic-standing-order-consent** resource.

* The POST action indicates to the ASPSP that a domestic standing order consent has been staged. At this point, the PSU may not have been identified by the ASPSP, and the request payload may not contain any information of the account that should be debited.
* The endpoint allows the PISP to send a copy of the consent (between PSU and PISP) to the ASPSP for the PSU to authorise.
* The ASPSP creates the **domestic-standing-order-consent** resource and responds with a unique ConsentId to refer to the resource.

#### Status

The default Status is "AWAU" immediately after the domestic-standing-order-consent has been created.

| Status |
| --- |
| AWAU |

### GET /domestic-standing-order-consents/{ConsentId}

A PISP can optionally retrieve a payment consent resource that they have created to check its status.

#### Status

Once the PSU authorises the payment-consent resource, the Status of the payment-consent resource will be updated with "AUTH".

If the PSU rejects the consent or the domestic-standing-order-consent has failed some other ASPSP validation, the Status will be set to "RJCT".

Once a domestic-standing-order has been successfully created using the domestic-standing-order-consent, the Status of the domestic-standing-order-consent will be set to "COND".

The available status codes for the domestic-standing-order-consent resource are:

| Status |
| --- |
| AWAU |
| RJCT |
| AUTH |
| COND |

Refer to [External_Internal_CodeSets](https://github.com/OpenBankingUK/External_Internal_CodeSets) -> OB_Internal_CodeSet -> `OBInternalPermissions1Code`.

### State Model

#### Payment Order Consent

The state model for the domestic-standing-order-consent resource follows the generic consent state model.

![State model](./images/PO_Consent.png)


The definitions for the Status:

|  |Status |Status Description |
| --- |------ |------------------ |
| 1 |AWAU |The consent resource is awaiting PSU authorisation. |
| 2 |RJCT |The consent resource has been rejected. |
| 3 |AUTH |The consent resource has been successfully authorised. |
| 4 |COND |The consented action has been successfully completed. This does not reflect the status of the consented action. |

Changes to the Status, such as being rejected, should be captured in `StatusReason`, an array of `StatusReasonCode`, `StatusReasonDescription` and `Path`.  

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| StatusReasonCode | Specifies the status reason in a code form. For a full description see `OBExternalStatusReason1Code` in `OB_Internal_CodeSet` [here](https://github.com/OpenBankingUK/External_Internal_CodeSets) |
| StatusReasonDescription | Description of why the code was returned |
|Path| Path is optional but relevant when the status reason refers to an object/field and hence conditional to provide JSON path. |
## Data Model

The Data Dictionary section gives the detail on the payload content for the Domestic Standing Order API flows.

##### UML Diagram

![Domestic Standing Order](./images/OBDomesticStandingOrder3.svg)

##### Notes

For the OBDomesticStandingOrder3 Initiation object: 

* All elements in the Initiation payload that are specified by the PISP must not be changed via the ASPSP, as this is part of formal consent from the PSU.
* If the ASPSP is able to establish a problem with payload or any contextual error during the API call, the ASPSP must reject the domestic-standing-order-consent request immediately.
* If the ASPSP establishes a problem with the domestic-standing-order-consent after the API call, the ASPSP can set the Status of the domestic-standing-order-consent resource to Rejected
* DebtorAccount is **optional** as the PISP may not know the account identification details for the PSU.
* If the DebtorAccount is specified by the PISP and is invalid for the PSU, then the domestic-standing-order-consent will be set to Rejected after PSU authentication.
* Account Identification field usage:
  * Where "UK.OBIE.SortCodeAccountNumber" is specified as the SchemeName in the Account identification section (either DebtorAccount or CreditorAccount), the Identification field **must** be populated with the 6 digit Sort Code and 8 digit Account Number (a 14 digit field).
  * Where the "UK.OBIE.IBAN" is specified as the SchemeName in the Account identification section (either DebtorAccount or CreditorAccount), the Identification field **must** be populated with the full IBAN.
* The Permission field is restricted to "Create", however, may be extended to "Update" and "Delete" in a future iteration of the specification.
* Either the CountPerPeriod or FinalPaymentDateTime must be specified (not both) if the domestic standing order is not open ended.
* The structure allows a PISP to specify a domestic standing order with a different payment amount and date combinations: for the first payment, the recurring payment, and the final payment. The recurring payment (and date) must only be populated if different from the first payment (and date).
* If the PISP requests a Frequency that is not supported by the ASPSP, the ASPSP **must** respond with a 400 HTTP status code and an appropriate ISO reason code. Refer to CEG for more guidance on common errors.
