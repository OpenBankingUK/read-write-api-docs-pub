## Overview

The International Scheduled Payments resource is used by a PISP to initiate an International Scheduled Payment.

This resource description should be read in conjunction with a compatible Payment Initiation API Profile.

## Endpoints

| Resource |HTTP Operation |Endpoint |Mandatory ? |Scope |Grant Type |Message Signing |Idempotency Key |Request Object |Response Object |
| --- |--- |--- |--- |--- |--- |--- |--- |--- |--- |
| international-scheduled-payments |POST |POST /international-scheduled-payments |Conditional |payments |Authorization Code |Signed Request Signed Response |Yes |OBWriteInternationalScheduled3 |OBWriteInternationalScheduledResponse6 |
| international-scheduled-payments |GET |GET /international-scheduled-payments/{InternationalScheduledPaymentId} |Mandatory (if resource POST implemented) |payments |Client Credentials |Signed Response |No |NA |OBWriteInternationalScheduledResponse6 |
| payment-details |GET |GET /international-scheduled-payments/{InternationalScheduledPaymentId}/payment-details |Optional |payments |Client Credentials |Signed Response |No |NA |OBWritePaymentDetailsResponse1 |

### POST /international-scheduled-payments

Once the international-scheduled-payment-consent has been authorised by the PSU, the PISP can proceed to submit the international-scheduled-payment for processing:

* This is done by making a POST request to the **international-scheduled-payments** endpoint.
* This request is an instruction to the ASPSP to begin the international scheduled payment journey. The PISP must submit the international scheduled payment immediately, however, there are some scenarios where the ASPSP may not warehouse the international scheduled payment immediately (e.g. busy periods at the ASPSP).
* The PISP **must** ensure that the Initiation and Risk sections of the international-scheduled-payment match the corresponding Initiation and Risk sections of the international-scheduled-payment-consent resource. If the two do not match, the ASPSP **must not** process the request and **must** respond with a 400 (Bad Request).
* Any operations on the international-scheduled-payment resource will not result in a Status change for the international-scheduled-payment resource.

#### Status

An international-scheduled-payment can only be created if its corresponding international-scheduled-payment-consent resource has the Status of "AUTH". 

The international-scheduled-payment resource that is created successfully must have one of the following initial status codes:

| Status |
| --- |
| RCVD |
| RJCT |

### GET /international-scheduled-payments/{InternationalScheduledPaymentId}

A PISP can retrieve the international-scheduled-payment to check its status.

#### Status

The international-scheduled-payment resource must have one of the following status codes:

| Status |
| --- |
| RCVD |
| CANC |
| PDNG |
| ACTC |
| PATC |
| ACCP |
| ACFC |
| ACSP |
| ACWC |
| ACSC |
| ACWP |
| ACCC |
| BLCK |
| RJCT |

### GET /international-scheduled-payments/{InternationalScheduledPaymentId}/payment-details

A PISP can retrieve the Details of the underlying payment transaction via this endpoint. This resource allows ASPSPs to return richer list of Payment Statuses, and if available payment scheme related statuses.

#### Status

The international-scheduled-payments - payment-details must have one of the following ExternalPaymentTransactionStatus1Code code-set enumerations (for more information see `ExternalPaymentTransactionStatus1Code` [here](https://github.com/OpenBankingUK/External_internal_CodeSets)) :

| Status |
| ------ |
| RCVD |
| CANC |
| PDNG |
| ACTC |
| PATC |
| ACCP |
| ACFC |
| ACSP |
| ACWC |
| ACSC |
| ACWP |
| ACCC |
| BLCK |
| RJCT |

Refer to [External_Internal_CodeSets](https://github.com/OpenBankingUK/External_Internal_CodeSets) -> ISO_External_CodeSet -> `ExternalPaymentTransactionStatus1Code`.

### State Model

#### Payment Order

The state model for the international-scheduled-payment resource describes the initiation status and the subsequent execution of the international-scheduled-payment.

__Payment order state model key:__
| Colour (Style) | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Green (Bold) | Mandatory |
| Orange (Italic) | Optional, but recommended |

![Payment Order Status](./images/PIS_PO_Statuses_1.png)

##### Multiple Authorisation
If the payment-order requires multiple authorisations the status of the multiple authorisations will be updated in the MultiAuthorisation object.

Once the payment is RCVD, the international-scheduled-payment Status must be set to PATC and the MultiAuthorisation object status updated with the AWAF status. Once all authorisations have been successfully completed the MultiAuthorisation status must be set to AUTH and international-scheduled-payment Status updated to ACSP if any intermediate status are not supported.

Any rejections in the multiple authorisation process should result in the MultiAuthorisation status and Status being set to RJCT. 


![Multi Auth](./images/PO_MultiAuthFlow.png)


The definitions for the Status:

|  |Status |Status Description |
| --- |--- |--- |
| 1 |AWAU |The payment-order resource is awaiting further authorisation. |
| 2 |RJCT |The payment-order resource has been rejected by an authoriser. |
| 3 |AUTH |The payment-order resource has been successfully authorised by all required authorisers. |
