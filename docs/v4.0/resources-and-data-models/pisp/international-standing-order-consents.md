## Overview

The International Standing Order Consent resource is used by a PISP to register an intent to initiate an International Standing Order.

This resource description should be read in conjunction with a compatible Payment Initiation API Profile.

## Endpoints

| Resource |HTTP Operation |Endpoint |Mandatory ? |Scope |Grant Type |Message Signing |Idempotency Key |Request Object |Response Object |
| --- |--- |--- |--- |--- |--- |--- |--- |--- |--- |
| international-standing-order-consents |POST |POST /international-standing-order-consents |Conditional |payments |Client Credentials |Signed Request Signed Response |Yes |OBWriteInternationalStandingOrderConsent6 |OBWriteInternationalStandingOrderConsentResponse7 |
| international-standing-order-consents |GET |GET /international-standing-order-consents/{ConsentId} |Mandatory (if resource POST implemented) |payments |Client Credentials |Signed Response |No |NA |OBWriteInternationalStandingOrderConsentResponse7 |

### POST /international-standing-order-consents

The API endpoint allows the PISP to ask an ASPSP to create a new **international-standing-order-consent** resource.

* The POST action indicates to the ASPSP that an international standing order consent has been staged. At this point, the PSU may not have been identified by the ASPSP, and the request payload may not contain any information of the account that should be debited.
* The endpoint allows the PISP to send a copy of the consent (between PSU and PISP) to the ASPSP for the PSU to authorise.
* The ASPSP creates the **international-standing-order-consent** resource and responds with a unique ConsentId to refer to the resource.

#### Status

The default Status is "AWAU" immediately after the international-standing-order-consent has been created.

| Status |
| --- |
| AWAU |


### GET /international-standing-order-consents/{ConsentId}

A PISP can optionally retrieve a payment consent resource that they have created to check its status. 

Refer to [External_Internal_CodeSets](https://github.com/OpenBankingUK/External_Internal_CodeSets) -> OB_Internal_CodeSet -> `OBInternalPermissions1Code`.

#### Status

Once the PSU authorises the payment-consent resource - the Status of the payment-consent resource will be updated with "AUTH".

If the PSU rejects the consent or the international-standing-order-consent has failed some other ASPSP validation, the Status will be set to "RJCT".

Once an international-standing-orders has been successfully created using the international-standing-order-consent, the Status of the international-standing-order-consent will be set to "COND".

The available status codes for the international-standing-order-consent resource are:

| Status |
| --- |
| AWAU |
| RJCT |
| AUTH |
| COND |

### State Model

#### Payment Order Consent

The state model for the international-standing-order-consent resource follows the generic consent state model. 

![State model](./images/PO_Consent.png)

The definitions for the Status:

|  |Status |Status Description |
| --- |--- |--- |
| 1 |AWAU |The consent resource is awaiting PSU authorisation. |
| 2 |RJCT |The consent resource has been rejected. |
| 3 |AUTH |The consent resource has been successfully authorised. |
| 4 |COND |The consented action has been successfully completed. This does not reflect the status of the consented action. |

Changes to the Status, such as being rejected, should be captured in `StatusReason`, an array of `StatusReasonCode`, `StatusReasonDescription` and `Path`.  

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| StatusReasonCode | Specifies the status reason in a code form. For a full description see `OBExternalStatusReason1Code` in `OB_Internal_CodeSet` [here](https://github.com/OpenBankingUK/External_Internal_CodeSets) |
| StatusReasonDescription | Description of why the code was returned |
|Path| Path is optional but relevant when the status reason refers to an object/field and hence conditional to provide JSON path. |

The data dictionary section gives the detail on the payload content for the International Standing Order API flows.

##### UML Diagram

##### Notes

For the OBInternationalStandingOrder4 Initiation object:

* All elements in the Initiation payload that are specified by the PISP must not be changed via the ASPSP - as this is part of formal consent from the PSU.
* If the ASPSP is able to establish a problem with payload or any contextual error during the API call, the ASPSP must reject the international-standing-order-consent request immediately.
* If the ASPSP establishes a problem with the international-standing-order-consent after the API call, the ASPSP must set the Status of the international-standing-order-consent resource to RJCT.
* The DebtorAccount is **optional** as the PISP may not know the account identification details for the PSU.
* If the DebtorAccount is specified by the PISP and is invalid for the PSU, then the international-standing-order-consent will be set to RJCT after PSU authentication.
* The CreditorAgent must at least have either of the pairs provided: SchemeName and Identification, or Name and PostalAddress.
* Account Identification field usage:
  * SchemeName is a free-text field which will be populated with identification schemes an ASPSP accepts.
  * Identification is a field which is populated with the Identification of the account, using the valid identification scheme provided.
* Valid UK Account Identification SchemeName values include, but are not restricted to:
  * "UK.OBIE.SortCodeAccountNumber" - The Identification field **must** be populated with the 6 digit Sort Code and 8 digit Account Number (a 14 digit field).
  * "UK.OBIE.IBAN" - The Identification field **must** be populated with the full IBAN.
  * "UK.OBIE.PAN" - The Identification field **must** be populated with the full PAN. A PAN may be an instrument (e.g., a debit card) linked to a payment account, and may not be the only PAN linked to the payment account.
* The InstructedAmount object **must** be populated with the desired Amount and Currency of transfer, regardless of the currency of the DebtorAccount. I.e., a PSU may wish to transfer 100EUR from a GBP DebtorAccount (InstructedAmount will be 100EUR), or 100GBP in EUR (the InstructedAmount will be 100GBP).
* The CurrencyOfTransfer **must** be used to specify the currency the funds will be transferred. I.e., a PSU may wish to transfer 100USD from a GBP DebtorAccount to a Rupee INR CreditorAccount in India.
* The ChargeBearer field is used by the PISP to indicate the bearer of charges. An ASPSP must Reject the Initiation request if the requested charge allocation cannot be fulfilled.
* Permission field is restricted to "Create", however, may be extended to "Update" and "Delete" in a future iteration of the specification.
