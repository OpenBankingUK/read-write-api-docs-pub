## Overview

The Domestic Scheduled Payments resource is used by a PISP to initiate a Domestic Scheduled Payment.

This resource description should be read in conjunction with a compatible Payment Initiation API Profile.

## Endpoints

| Resource |HTTP Operation |Endpoint |Mandatory ? |Scope |Grant Type |Message Signing |Idempotency Key |Request Object |Response Object |
| -------- |-------------- |-------- |----------- |----- |---------- |--------------- |--------------- |-------------- |--------------- |
| domestic-scheduled-payments |POST |POST /domestic-scheduled-payments |Conditional |payments |Authorization Code |Signed Request Signed Response |Yes |OBWriteDomesticScheduled2 |OBWriteDomesticScheduledResponse5 |
| domestic-scheduled-payments |GET |GET /domestic-scheduled-payments/{DomesticScheduledPaymentId} |Mandatory (if resource POST implemented) |payments |Client Credentials |Signed Response |No |NA |OBWriteDomesticScheduledResponse5 |
| payment-details |GET |GET /domestic-scheduled-payments/{DomesticScheduledPaymentId}/payment-details |Optional |payments |Client Credentials |Signed Response |No |NA |OBWritePaymentDetailsResponse1 |

### POST /domestic-scheduled-payments

Once the domestic-scheduled-payment-consent has been authorised by the PSU, the PISP can proceed to submitting the domestic-scheduled-payment for processing:

* This is done by making a POST request to the **domestic-scheduled-payments** endpoint.
* This request is an instruction to the ASPSP to begin the domestic scheduled payment journey. The PISP must submit the domestic scheduled payment immediately, however, there are some scenarios where the ASPSP may not warehouse the domestic scheduled payment immediately (e.g., busy periods at the ASPSP)
* The PISP **must** ensure that the Initiation and Risk sections of the domestic-scheduled-payment match the corresponding Initiation and Risk sections of the domestic-scheduled-payment-consent resource. If the two do not match, the ASPSP **must not** process the request and **must** respond with a 400 (Bad Request).
* Any operations on the domestic-scheduled-payment resource will not result in a Status change for the domestic-scheduled-payment resource.

#### Status

A domestic-scheduled-payment can only be created if its corresponding domestic-scheduled-payment-consent resource has the Status of "AUTH". 

The domestic-scheduled-payment resource that is created successfully must have one of the following initial status codes:

| Status |
| ------ |
| RCVD |
| RJCT |

### GET /domestic-scheduled-payments/{DomesticScheduledPaymentId}

A PISP can retrieve the domestic-scheduled-payment to check its status.

#### Status

The domestic-scheduled-payment resource must have one of the following status codes:

| Status |
| ------ |
| RCVD |
| CANC |
| PDNG |
| ACTC |
| PATC |
| ACCP |
| ACFC |
| ACSP |
| ACWC |
| ACSC |
| ACWP |
| ACCC |
| BLCK |
| RJCT |

### GET /domestic-scheduled-payments/{DomesticScheduledPaymentId}/payment-details

A PISP can retrieve the Details of the underlying payment transaction via this endpoint. This resource allows ASPSPs to return richer list of Payment Statuses, and if available payment scheme related statuses.

#### Status

The domestic-scheduled-payments - payment-details must have one of the following PaymentStatusCode code-set enumerations:

| Status |
| ------ |
| RCVD |
| CANC |
| PDNG |
| ACTC |
| PATC |
| ACCP |
| ACFC |
| ACSP |
| ACWC |
| ACSC |
| ACWP |
| ACCC |
| BLCK |
| RJCT |

Refer to [External_Internal_CodeSets](https://github.com/OpenBankingUK/External_Internal_CodeSets) -> ISO_External_CodeSet -> `ExternalPaymentTransactionStatus1Code`.

### State Model

#### Payment Order

The state model for the domestic-scheduled-payment resource describes the initiation and subsequent execution of the domestic-scheduled-payment.

__Payment order state model key:__
| Colour (Style) | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Green (Bold) | Mandatory |
| Orange (Italic) | Optional, but recommended |

![Payment Order Status](./images/PIS_PO_FDPStatuses_1.png)


##### Multiple Authorisation
If the payment-order requires multiple authorisations the status of the multiple authorisations will be updated in the MultiAuthorisation object.

Once the payment is RCVD, the domestic-scheduled-payment Status must be set to PATC and the MultiAuthorisation object status updated with the AWAF status. Once all authorisations have been successfully completed the MultiAuthorisation status must be set to AUTH and domestic-scheduled-payment Status updated to ACSP if any intermediate status are not supported.

Any rejections in the multiple authorisation process should result in the MultiAuthorisation status and Status being set to RJCT. 


![Multi Auth](./images/PO_MultiAuthFlow.png)

|  | Status |Status Description |
| ---| ------ |------------------ |
| 1 |AWAF |The payment-order resource is awaiting further authorisation. |
| 2 |RJCT |The payment-order resource has been rejected. |
| 3 |AUTH |The payment-order resource has been successfully authorised. |

Refer to [External_Internal_CodeSets](https://github.com/OpenBankingUK/External_Internal_CodeSets) -> OB_Internal_CodeSet -> `OBInternalStatus2Code`.
