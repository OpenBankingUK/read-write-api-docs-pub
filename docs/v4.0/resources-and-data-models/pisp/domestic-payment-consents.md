## Overview

The Domestic Payments Consent resource is used by a PISP to register an intent to initiate a Domestic Payment.

This resource description should be read in conjunction with a compatible Payment Initiation API Profile.

## Endpoints

| Resource |HTTP Operation |Endpoint |Mandatory ? |Scope |Grant Type |Message Signing |Idempotency Key |Request Object |Response Object |
| -------- |-------------- |-------- |----------- |----- |---------- |--------------- |--------------- |-------------- |--------------- |
| domestic-payment-consents |POST |POST /domestic-payment-consents |Mandatory |payments |Client Credentials |Signed Request Signed Response |Yes |OBWriteDomesticConsent4 |OBWriteDomesticConsentResponse5 |
| domestic-payment-consents |GET |GET /domestic-payment-consents/{ConsentId} |Mandatory |payments |Client Credentials |Signed Response |No |NA |OBWriteDomesticConsentResponse5 |
| domestic-payment-consents |GET |GET /domestic-payment-consents/{ConsentId}/funds-confirmation |Mandatory |payments |Authorization Code |Signed Response |No |NA |OBWriteFundsConfirmationResponse1 |

### POST /domestic-payment-consents

The API endpoint allows the PISP to ask an ASPSP to create a new **domestic-payment-consent** resource.

* The POST action indicates to the ASPSP that a domestic payment consent has been staged. At this point, the PSU may not have been identified by the ASPSP, and the request payload may not contain any information of the account that should be debited.
* The endpoint allows the PISP to send a copy of the consent (between PSU and PISP) to the ASPSP for the PSU to authorise.
* The ASPSP creates the **domestic-payment-consent** resource and responds with a unique ConsentId to refer to the resource.

#### Status

The default Status is &quot;AWAU&quot; immediately after the domestic-payment-consent has been created.

| Status |
| ------ |
| AWAU |

### GET /domestic-payment-consents/{ConsentId}

A PISP can optionally retrieve a payment consent resource that they have created to check its status.

#### Status

Once the PSU authorises the payment-consent resource - the Status of the payment-consent resource will be updated with &quot;AUTH&quot;.

If the PSU rejects the consent or the domestic-payment-consent has failed some other ASPSP validation, the Status will be set to &quot;RJCT&quot;.

Once a domestic-payment has been successfully created using the domestic-payment-consent, the Status of the domestic-payment-consent will be set to &quot;COND&quot;.

The available status codes for the domestic-payment-consent resource are:

| Status |
| ------ |
| AWAU |
| RJCT |
| AUTH |
| COND |
### GET /domestic-payment-consents/{ConsentId}/funds-confirmation

The API endpoint allows the PISP to ask an ASPSP to confirm funds on a **domestic-payment-consent** resource.

* An ASPSP can only respond to a funds confirmation request if the **domestic-payment-consent** resource has an Authorised status. If the status is not Authorised, an ASPSP must respond with a 400 (Bad Request) and a ```U009``` error code.
* Confirmation of funds requests do not affect the status of the **domestic-payment-consent** resource.

Refer to [External_Internal_CodeSets](https://github.com/OpenBankingUK/External_Internal_CodeSets) -> OB_Internal_CodeSet -> `OBInternalPermissions1Code`.

### State Model

#### Payment Order Consent

The state model for the domestic-payment-consent resource follows the generic consent state model.

![Payment Order Consent](./images/PO_Consent.png)


The definitions for the Status:

|  | Status |Status Description |
| ---| ------ |------------------ |
| 1 |AWAU |The consent resource is awaiting PSU authorisation. |
| 2 |RJCT |The consent resource has been rejected. |
| 3 |AUTH |The consent resource has been successfully authorised. |
|4 |COND|The consented action has been successfully completed. This does not reflect the status of the consented action.|

Changes to the Status, such as being rejected, should be captured in `StatusReason`, an array of `StatusReasonCode`, `StatusReasonDescription` and `Path`.  

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| StatusReasonCode | Specifies the status reason in a code form. For a full description see `OBExternalStatusReason1Code` [here](https://github.com/OpenBankingUK/External_Internal_CodeSets) |
| StatusReasonDescription | Description of why the code was returned |
|Path| Path is optional but relevant when the status reason refers to an object/field and hence conditional to provide JSON path. |

## Data Model

The data dictionary section gives the detail on the payload content for the Domestic Payment API flows.

#### OBUltimateCreditor1

The OBUltimateCreditor1 class is defined in the [payment-initiation-api-profile](../../profiles/payment-initiation-api-profile.md#obultimatecreditor1) page.


#### OBUltimateDebtor1

##### UML Diagram

![OBDomestic2](./images/OBDomestic2.svg)

##### Notes

For the OBDomestic2 Initiation object:  

* All elements in the Initiation payload that are specified by the PISP must not be changed via the ASPSP as this is part of formal consent from the PSU.
* If the ASPSP is able to establish a problem with payload or any contextual error during the API call, the ASPSP must reject the domestic-payment-consent request immediately.
* If the ASPSP establishes a problem with the domestic-payment-consent after the API call, the ASPSP must set the Status of the domestic-payment-consent resource to 'RJCT' (Rejected).
* DebtorAccount is **optional** as the PISP may not know the account identification details for the PSU.
* If the DebtorAccount is specified by the PISP and is invalid for the PSU, then the domestic-payment-consent will be set to Rejected after PSU authentication.
* Account Identification field usage:
  * Where "UK.OBIE.SortCodeAccountNumber" is specified as the SchemeName in the Account identification section (either DebtorAccount or CreditorAccount), the Identification field **must** be populated with the 6 digit Sort Code and 8 digit Account Number (a 14 digit field).
  * Where the "UK.OBIE.IBAN" is specified as the SchemeName in the Account identification section (either DebtorAccount or CreditorAccount), the Identification field must be populated with the full IBAN.
* The element Reference has been renamed from CreditorReferenceInformation as this is the unique ISO 20022 element used in pain.001, rather than an ISO 20022 message component.
* As a merchant may be initiating a payment via a PISP two identifiers are included in the payload: 
  * InstructionIdentification is uniquely generated by the PISP. The expectation is that this is unique indefinitely across all time periods. The PISP can ensure that this is indefinitely unique by including a date or date-time element to the field, or by inserting a unique Id. 
  * EndToEndIdentification is uniquely generated by the merchant.
* Neither the InstructionIdentification nor EndToEndIdentification will be used as the domestic-payment-consent resource identifier (ConsentId) as the ConsentId must be uniquely generated by the ASPSP.
* LocalInstrument is the requested payment scheme for execution. This is a free-text field.
* Design decisions for the Initiation section of the payload and how this maps to the ISO 20022 messaging standard are articulated in the Mapping to Schemes and Standards section.
