## Overview

The transactions resource is used by an AISP to retrieve the  transactions for a specific AccountId or to retrieve the transactions in bulk for account(s) that the PSU has authorised to access.

This resource description should be read in conjunction with a compatible Account Information Services API Profile.

## Endpoints

Endpoints for the resource - and available methods.

|  |Resource |HTTP Operation |Endpoint |Mandatory? |Scope |Grant Type |Idempotency Key |Parameters |Request Object |Response Object |
| --- |--- |--- |--- |--- |--- |--- |--- |--- |--- |--- |
| 1 |transactions |GET |GET /accounts/{AccountId}/transactions |Mandatory |accounts |Authorization Code |No |Pagination Filtering | |OBReadTransaction6 |
| 2 |transactions |GET |GET /transactions |Optional |accounts |Authorization Code |No |Pagination Filtering | |OBReadTransaction6 |

### GET /accounts/{AccountId}/transactions

An AISP  **may**  retrieve the transaction resource for a specific AccountId (which is retrieved in the call to GET /accounts).

### GET /transactions

If an ASPSP has implemented the bulk retrieval endpoints, an AISP  **may**  optionally retrieve the transactions in bulk.
This will retrieve the resources for all authorised accounts linked to the account-request.

## Data Model

The OBReadTransaction6 object will be used for the call to:

* GET /accounts/{AccountId}/transactions
* GET /transactions
* GET /accounts/{AccountId}/statements/{StatementId}transactions

### Resource Definition

A resource that describes a posting to an account that results in an increase or decrease to a balance.
For a specific date range, an account (AccountId) may have no transactions booked, or may have multiple transactions booked.

#### Notes

* The use of the term "Transaction" has been made consistently in the Transaction endpoint payload (instead of "Entry" which is the ISO20022 element name).
* A DateTime element has been used instead of a complex choice element of Date and DateTime. Where time elements do not exist in ASPSP systems, the time portion of the DateTime element will be defaulted to 00:00:00+00:00.
* The BookingDateTime has been set to mandatory as all ASPSPs must provide this field for pagination and filtering. The BookingDateTime is the date the transaction is booked (or posted) and becomes immutable, which is not the date the transaction took place.
* For CreditCard transactions that are not yet booked, ASPSPs must populate the `BookingDateTime` field with an expected booking date.  
* Either the BankTransactionCode (which is the ISO transaction code list), **or** ProprietaryBankTransactionCode, **or** **both** may be populated. While the expectation is that at least one of BankTransactionCode. or ProprietaryBankTransactionCode are populated, we have decided not to enforce this behaviour in the payload structure as this would require nesting elements and introducing complex choice elements.
* The BankTransactionCode (ISO) code-list is documented on the ISO20022 website: [here](https://www.iso20022.org/external_code_list.page); and External Code Sets spreadsheet.
  * The ISO 20022 BankTransactionCode Code and SubCode are specified as 4 letter codes. 
* ASPSPs must have the ability to provide transactions through APIs for a period that at least equals the period provided through their online channels.
* ExtendedProprietaryBankTransactionCodes is a OB Proprietary field (introduced by TDA decision 264) to support multiple proprietry Bank Transaction Codes that may be associated with the transaction, in addition to a single default one. The expectation is to capture the default under ProprietaryBankTransactionCode. The ASPSP must publish all the proprietary and extended proprietary bank transaction codes along with usage on their developer portal.

### Filtering

Limited support for filtering is provided on the  **transactions**  resource.

| Name |Occurrence |Enhanced Definition |Class |
| --- |--- |--- |--- |
| fromBookingDateTime |0..1 |Specifies start date and time for filtering of the Transaction records on the Transaction/BookingDateTime field |ISODateTime |
| toBookingDateTime |0..1 |Specifies end date and time for filtering of the Transaction records on the Transaction/BookingDateTime field. |ISODateTime |

The ASPSP must treat the following as valid input:

* Non-working days (e.g. a Sunday or a Bank holiday) or any other days on which no transactions are recorded.
* Dates that fall outside the range for which transaction information is provided through APIs.
* Dates that fall outside the range for which a consent authorisation is available.
* Timezone may be included in the filter request, but must be ignored by the ASPSP.

In the above situations, the ASPSP must return data for the remaining valid period specified by the filter.

#### Filtering Examples

```
// All transactions from 1st Jan, 2015
GET /transactions?fromBookingDateTime=2015-01-01T00:00:00

// All transactions in 2016
GET /transactions?fromBookingDateTime=2016-01-01T00:00:00&amp;toBookingDateTime=2016-12-31T23:59:59

// All transactions in a specific account up to 31-Mar-2017
GET /accounts/1/transactions?toBookingDateTime=2017-03-31T23:59:59
```

### Mutability

Due to the way that ASPSPs and payment systems operate, some of the fields in a transaction may change for a short period of time before it settles into an eventual immutable state.

Prior to Version 3.1.5, there was no specific flag to indicate the mutability of a transaction record and TPPs inferred it from the `Status` field. As an "unstated" standard, a transaction with a status of `Pending` was considered to be mutable (ie some of its fields like date, description and amount may change or the transaction may be backed out completely) while a `Booked` transaction was considered to be immutable. There were however, some edge cases where a `Booked` transaction may suffer from changes to some fields.

Since Version 3.1.5, the mutability for a transaction has been made explicit:

* A transaction with a `Status` of `PDNG` is mutable
* A transaction with a `Status` of `BOOK` where the `TransactionMutability` flag is not specified is immutable.
* A transaction with a `Status` of `BOOK` with the `TransactionMutability` flag set to `Immutable` is immutable.
* A transaction with a `Status` of `BOOK` with the `TransactionMutability` flag set to `Mutable` is mutable.

#### Examples to illustrate mutability

```
// Mutable ( Status is PDNG )
{
  "Status": "PDNG",
  ...
}

// Immutable (Status is BOOK, TransactionMutability is not specified)
{
  "Status": "BOOK"
  ...
}

// Mutable
{
  "Status": "BOOK",
  "TransactionMutability": "Mutable"
}

// Immutable
{
  "Status": "BOOK",
  "TransactionMutability": "Immutable"
}
```

### Permission Codes

The resource differs depending on the permissions (ReadTransactionsBasic and ReadTransactionsDetail in addition to the appropriate ReadTransactionsCredits and/or ReadTransactionsDebits) used to access resource. In the event the resource is accessed with both ReadTransactionsBasic and ReadTransactionsDetail, the most detailed level (ReadTransactionsDetail) must be used.

* These objects **must not** be returned **without** the **ReadTransactionsDetail** permission:
  * OBReadTransaction6/Data/Transaction/TransactionInformation
  * OBReadTransaction6/Data/Transaction/Balance
  * OBReadTransaction6/Data/Transaction/MerchantDetails
  * OBReadTransaction6/Data/Transaction/CreditorAgent
  * OBReadTransaction6/Data/Transaction/CreditorAccount
  * OBReadTransaction6/Data/Transaction/UltimateCreditor
  * OBReadTransaction6/Data/Transaction/DebtorAgent
  * OBReadTransaction6/Data/Transaction/DebtorAccount
  * OBReadTransaction6/Data/Transaction/UltimateDebtor
* If the **ReadTransactionsDetail** is granted by the PSU:
  * OBReadTransaction6/Data/Transaction/TransactionInformation **may** be returned if applicable to the transaction and ASPSP (0..1)
  * OBReadTransaction6/Data/Transaction/Balance **may** be returned if applicable to the transaction and ASPSP (0..1)
  * OBReadTransaction6/Data/Transaction/MerchantDetails **may** be returned if applicable to the transaction and ASPSP (0..1)
  * OBReadTransaction6/Data/Transaction/CreditorAgent **may** be returned if applicable to the transaction and ASPSP (0..1)
  * OBReadTransaction6/Data/Transaction/CreditorAccount **may** be returned if applicable to the transaction and ASPSP (0..1)
  * OBReadTransaction6/Data/Transaction/UltimateCreditor **may** be returned if applicable to the transaction and ASPSP (0..1)
  * OBReadTransaction6/Data/Transaction/DebtorAgent **may** be returned if applicable to the transaction and ASPSP (0..1)
  * OBReadTransaction6/Data/Transaction/DebtorAccount **may** be returned if applicable to the transaction and ASPSP (0..1)
  * OBReadTransaction6/Data/Transaction/UltimateDebtor **may** be returned if applicable to the transaction and ASPSP (0..1)

* If the ReadPAN permission is granted by the PSU - the ASPSP may choose to populate the unmasked PAN - if the PAN is being populated in the response for these fields:

  * OBReadTransaction6/Data/Transaction/CreditorAccount/Identification
  * OBReadTransaction6/Data/Transaction/DebtorAccount/Identification
  * OBReadTransaction6/Data/Transaction/CardInstrument/Identification

* If the `ReadTransactionDebits` permission is granted by the PSU, the data returned should include debit transactions.
* If the `ReadTransactionCredits` permission is granted by the PSU, the data returned should include credit transactions.
* If the `ReadTransactionCredits` and `ReadTransactionDebits` permission is granted by the PSU, the data returned should include debit and credit transactions.

### No Access
