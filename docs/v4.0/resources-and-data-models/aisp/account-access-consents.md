## Overview

The Account Access Consents API is used by an AISP to request an ASPSP to create a new account-access-consent resource, retrieve the status of account-access-consent resource and delete the account-access-consent resource.

This resource description should be read in conjunction with a compatible Account Information Services API Profile.

## Endpoints

|  |Resource |HTTP Operation |Endpoint |Mandatory? |Scope |Grant Type |Idempotency Key |Parameters |Request Object |Response Object |
| --- |--- |--- |--- |--- |--- |--- |--- |--- |--- |--- |
| 1 |account-access-consents |POST |POST /account-access-consents |Mandatory |accounts |Client Credentials |No | |OBReadConsent1 |OBReadConsentResponse1 |
| 2 |account-access-consents |GET |GET /account-access-consents/{ConsentId} |Mandatory |accounts |Client Credentials |No | | |OBReadConsentResponse1 |
| 3 |account-access-consents |DELETE |DELETE /account-access-consents/{ConsentId} |Mandatory |accounts |Client Credentials |No | | | |

### POST /account-access-consents

The API allows the AISP to ask an ASPSP to create a new account-access-consent resource.

* This API effectively allows the AISP to send a copy of the consent to the ASPSP to authorise access to account and transaction information.
* An AISP is not able to pre-select a set of accounts for account-access-consent authorisation. This is because the behaviour of the pre-selected accounts, after authorisation, is not clear from a Legal perspective.
* An ASPSP creates the account-access-consent resource and responds with a unique ConsentId to refer to the resource.
* Prior to calling the API, the AISP must have an access token issued by the ASPSP using a client credentials grant.


#### Account Access Consent Status

The PSU  **must**  authenticate with the ASPSP and authorise the account-access-consent for the account-access-consent to be successfully setup.
The account-access-consent resource that is created successfully must have the following Status code-list enumeration:

|  |Status |Status Description |
| --- |--- |--- |
| 1 |AWAU |The account access consent is awaiting authorisation. |

After authorisation has taken place the account-access-consent resource may have these following statuses.

|  |Status |Status Description |
| --- |--- |--- |
| 1 |RJCT |The account access consent has been rejected. |
| 2 |AUTH |The account access consent has been successfully authorised. |


#### Status Flow

This is the state diagram for the Status.

![ Consent Authorisation.jpg ](./images/AIS_Consent.png )

### GET /account-access-consents/{ConsentId}

An AISP may optionally retrieve an account-access-consent resource that they have created to check its status.

Prior to calling the API, the AISP must have an access token issued by the ASPSP using a client credentials grant.

The usage of this API endpoint will be subject to an ASPSP's fair usage policies.

#### Account Access Consent Status

Once the PSU authorises the account-access-consent resource - the Status of the account-access-consent resource will be updated with "AUTH".

The available Status code-list enumerations for the account-access-consent resource are:

|  |Status |Status Description |
| --- |--- |--- |
| 1 |RJCT |The account access consent has been rejected. |
| 2 |AWAU |The account access consent is awaiting authorisation. |
| 3 |AUTH |The account access consent has been successfully authorised. |
| 4| CANC | PSU has cancelled access given to the TPP using the ASPSPs access dashboard.  OR ASPSP has revoked the access token or the token has been suspended. |
| 5| EXPD | The consent has passed its expiry date. The ASPSP then marks the consent as ‘Expired’ | 

Changes to the Status, such as being rejected, should be captured in `StatusReason`, an array of `StatusReasonCode`, `StatusReasonDescription` and `Path`.  

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| StatusReasonCode | Specifies the status reason in a code form. For a full description see `OBExternalStatusReason1Code` [here](https://github.com/OpenBankingUK/External_Internal_CodeSets)  |
| StatusReasonDescription | Description of why the code was returned |
|Path| Path is optional but relevant when the status reason refers to an object/field and hence conditional to provide JSON path.  |


### DELETE /account-access-consents/{ConsentId}

If the PSU revokes consent to data access with the AISP, the AISP  **must**  delete the account-access-consent resource with the ASPSP as soon as is practically possible.

* This is done by making a call to DELETE the account-access-consent resource.
* Prior to calling the API, the AISP must have an access token issued by the ASPSP using a client credentials grant.

TPP should also clear the Account Access Consent resources, from ASPSP's system, which are:
* Expired, i.e. ExpirationDateTime is lapsed, or ExpirationDateTime is not lapsed, but PSU doesn't want to refresh/re-authenticate it, and
* Consent Resource may never be referenced by the PSU in AISP or ASPSP domain.

## Data Model

### Account Access Consents - Request

The OBReadConsent1 object will be used for the call to:

* POST /account-access-consents

#### UML Diagram

![ OBReadConsent1 ](./images/OBReadConsent1.svg )

#### Notes

* The fields in the OBReadConsent1 object are described in the Consent Elements section.
* No fields have been identified for the Risk section.

| Risk | 1..1 | OBReadConsent1/Risk | The Risk section is sent by the initiating party to the ASPSP. It is used to specify additional details for risk scoring for Account Info. | OBRisk2 | |

### Account Access Consents - Response

The OBReadConsentResponse1 object will be used for the call to:

* GET /account-access-consents/{ConsentId}

And response to:

* POST /account-access-consents

#### UML Diagram

![ OBReadConsentResponse1 ](./images/OBReadConsentResponse1.svg )

#### Notes

* The OBReadConsentResponse1 object contains the same information as the OBReadConsent1, but with additional fields:
    * ConsentId - to uniquely identify the account-access-consent resource.
    * Status.
    * StatusReason.
    * CreationDateTime.
    * StatusUpdateDateTime.
* No fields have been identified for the Risk section.

### Delete Account Access Consent

The DELETE /account-access-consents call allows an AISP to delete a previously created account-access-consent (whether it is currently authorised or not). The PSU may want to remove their consent via the AISP instead of revoking authorisation with the ASPSP.

This API call allows the PSU to revoke consent with the AISP, and for that consent to be reflected in authorisation with the ASPSP.
