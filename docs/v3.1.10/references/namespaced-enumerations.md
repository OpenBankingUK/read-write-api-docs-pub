## Overview

The specification defines certain fields with only a fixed set of possible values as enumerations, and further additions to possible values require a Specification change.

As part of Version 3 OBIE Specifications defined new custom Data Types, which are an extendable list of enumerated values. Any extensions to this standard list of values can be done by the ASPSPs, with relevant documentation on their Developer Portals.

The extendable Data Type values are namespaced, to help identify the issuer of the value, and the relevant value.

## Basics

These Data Types, in general, are called namespaced enumerations.

Specific API Data Dictionary will define a custom Data Type class, which will help lookup the OBIE defined standard set of namespaced enumerations in this specification page as well as respective swagger files.

The namespaced enumeration values specified by Open Banking are documented here and will be prefixed by `UK.OBIE.`

### Design Principles

When extending a namespaced enumeration:
* ASPSPs **must not** publish an ASPSP-specific enumerated value where a generic OBIE defined enumerated value may be used.
* ASPSPs **must** place such values in a namespace consisting of their two-letter country code (ISO 3166-1 Alpha-2 code), followed by a full-stop, followed by their name. e.g.
  *  UK.Barclays.PingIt
  *  KE.Safaricom.M-Pesa

### Release Management

Usage of non-namespaced values may be discontinued in a future version of this standard.

As a special case and in order to minimise disruption between versions of the standard, a TPP **may** specify previous non-namespaces values, e.g. IBAN instead of UK.OBIE.IBAN.

In ASPSP generated responses, however, an ASPSP **must** always respond with fully namespaced values.

## Common Namespaced Enumerations

The following namespaced enumerations are used across all the standards.

### OBExternalAccountIdentification4Code

This is Data Type for Account/SchemeName and used to identify the type of Identification used to identify an account.

| Code |Description |
| --- |--- |
| UK.OBIE.BBAN |Basic Bank Account Number (BBAN) - identifier used nationally by financial institutions, ie, in individual countries, generally as part of a National Account Numbering Scheme(s), to uniquely identify the account of a customer. |
| UK.OBIE.IBAN |An identifier used internationally by financial institutions to uniquely identify the account of a customer at a financial institution, as described in the latest edition of the international standard ISO 13616. "Banking and related financial services - International Bank Account Number (IBAN)". |
| UK.OBIE.PAN |Primary Account Number - identifier scheme used to identify a card account. |
| UK.OBIE.Paym |Paym Scheme to make payments via mobile |
| UK.OBIE.SortCodeAccountNumber |Sort Code and Account Number - identifier scheme used in the UK by financial institutions to identify the account of a customer. The identifier is the concatenation of the 6 digit UK sort code and 8 digit account number.<br>The regular expression for this identifier is: ^[0-9]{6}[0-9]{8}$ |


### OBExternalFinancialInstitutionIdentification4Code

This is the Data Type for Agent/SchemeName and used to identify the type of Identification used to identify an agent.

| Code |Description |
| --- |--- |
| UK.OBIE.BICFI |Valid BICs for financial institutions are registered by the ISO 9362 Registration Authority in the BIC directory, and consist of eight (8) or eleven (11) contiguous characters. |
| UK.OBIE.NCC.[ISO3166-aplha2-CountryCode] | Valid NCC (National Clearing Code) as an option for the accounts that don't have an IBAN, registered in the country identified by the 2 letter ISO-3166 Country code. For example, transfer to India may have Scheme Name as UK.OBIE.NCC.IN and Identification can be the IFSC code of the bank/branch in India. |

### OBErrorResponseError1Code

This is Data Type gives a low level textual error code to help categorise an error response. The applicable HTTP response code is also given.

<details><summary>Show</summary>

| Code |HTTP Status Category |Description |
| --- |--- |--- |
| UK.OBIE.Field.Expected |400 |For the scenario, when a field-value is not provided in the payload, that is expected in combination with preceding field-value pairs.<br><br>The corresponding path must be populated with the path of the unexpected field.<br><br>E.g.<br><br>ExchangeRate must be specified with Agreed RateType. ExchangeRate should be specified in the path element.<br><br>InstructionPriority must be specified with Agreed RateType. InstructionPriority should be specified in the path element. |
| UK.OBIE.Field.Invalid |400 |An invalid value is supplied in one of the fields, or the length of value supplied is larger than the corresponding maximum field length in ASPSP's domain. Reference of the invalid field should be provided in the path field, and the URL field may have the link to a website explaining the valid behaviour. The error message should describe the problem in detail. |
| UK.OBIE.Field.InvalidDate |400 |An invalid date is supplied e.g. when a future date is expected, a date in past or current date is supplied. The message can specify the actual problem with the date. The reference of the invalid field should be provided in the path field, and URL field may have the link to a website explaining the valid behaviour |
| UK.OBIE.Field.Missing |400 |A mandatory field, required for the API, is missing from the payload. This error code can be used, if it is not already captured under the validation for UK.OBIE.Resource.InvalidFormat.<br><br>Reference of the missing field should be provided in the path field, and URL field may have the link to a website explaining the valid behaviour |
| UK.OBIE.Field.Unexpected |400 |For the scenario, when a field-value is provided in the payload, that is not expected in combination with preceding field-value pairs.

| UK.OBIE.Resource.InvalidConsentStatus |400 |The resource’s associated consent is not in a status that would allow the resource to be created, or a request to be executed.<br><br>E.g., if a consent resource had a status of AwaitingAuthorisation or Rejected, a resource could not be created against this consent.<br><br>The path element should be populated with the field in the consent resource that is invalid. |
