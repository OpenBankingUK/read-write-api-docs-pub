## Overview

The standing-orders resource is used by an AISP to retrieve the standing orders for a specific AccountId or to retrieve the standing orders in bulk for all the accounts that the PSU has consented to.

This resource description should be read in conjunction with a compatible Account Information Services API Profile.

## Endpoints

Endpoints for the resource and available methods.

|  |Resource |HTTP Operation |Endpoint |Mandatory? |Scope |Grant Type |Idempotency Key |Parameters |Request Object |Response Object |
| --- |--- |--- |--- |--- |--- |--- |--- |--- |--- |--- |
| 1 |standing-orders |GET |GET /accounts/{AccountId}/standing-orders |Conditional |accounts |Authorization Code |No |Pagination | |OBReadStandingOrder6 |
| 2 |standing-orders |GET |GET /standing-orders |Optional |accounts |Authorization Code |No |Pagination | |OBReadStandingOrder6 |

### GET /accounts/{AccountId}/standing-orders

An AISP may retrieve the standing-order resource for a specific AccountId (which is retrieved in the call to GET /accounts).

### GET /standing-orders

If an ASPSP has implemented the bulk retrieval endpoints, an AISP may optionally retrieve the standing-order resources in bulk.
This will retrieve the resources for all authorised accounts linked to the account-request.

## Data Model

The OBReadStandingOrder6 object will be used for the call to:

* GET /accounts/{AccountId}/standing-orders
* GET /standing-orders

### Resource Definition

A resource that contains a set of elements that describes the list of standing-orders that have been set up on a specific account (AccountId).
An account (AccountId) may have no standing orders set up, or may have multiple standing orders set up.

### UML Diagram

### Notes

* The **Creditor Account** and **CreditorAgent** blocks replicate what is used consistently throughout the Account Information APIs to identify an account.
* For the /accounts/{AccountId}/standing-orders endpoint, the **Creditor Account** and **CreditorAgent** blocks represent the account that is receiving funds (so has been named the CreditorAccount for consistency with the PISP use case).
* A DateTime element has been used so that there is consistency across all API endpoints using dates. Where time elements do not exist in ASPSP systems, the time portion of the DateTime element will be defaulted to 00:00:00+00:00.
* The Amount elements all have embedded Currency elements for consistency is ISO 20022, and across the other API endpoints.
* ASPSPs must give TPPs at least three month's notice, prior to implementing any change in the code-lists of the fields, if such a change impacts the ability of TPPs to continue with the provision of their service.
  
### Frequency Examples

| Frequency |Example |Details |
| --- |--- |--- |
| NotKnown |NotKnown |Not known |
| EvryDay |EvryDay |Every day |
| EvryWorkgDay |EvryWorkgDay |Every working day |
| IntrvlDay |IntrvlDay:15 |Every 15 Calendar day. |
| IntrvlWkDay |IntrvlWkDay:01:03 |Every week, on the 3rd day of the week |
| IntrvlWkDay |IntrvlWkDay:02:03 |Every 2nd week, on the 3rd day of the week |

| IntrvlMnthDay |IntrvlMnthDay:01:-01 |Every month, on the last day of the month |
| IntrvlMnthDay |IntrvlMnthDay:06:15 |Every 6th month, on the 15th day of the month |
| QtrDay |QtrDay:ENGLISH |Paid on the 25th March, 24th June, 29th September and 25th December |

### Permission Codes

The resource differs depending on the permissions (ReadStandingOrdersBasic and ReadStandingOrdersDetail) used to access resource. In the event the resource is accessed with both ReadStandingOrdersBasic and ReadStandingOrdersDetail, the most detailed level (ReadStandingOrdersDetail) must be used.

* These objects **must not** be returned **without** the **ReadStandingOrdersDetail** permission:
    * OBReadStandingOrder6/Data/StandingOrder/CreditorAgent
    * OBReadStandingOrder6/Data/StandingOrder/CreditorAccount
* If the **ReadStandingOrdersDetail** is granted by the PSU:     
    * OBReadStandingOrder6/Data/StandingOrder/CreditorAgent **may** be returned if applicable to the account and ASPSP (0..1)
    * OBReadStandingOrder6/Data/StandingOrder/CreditorAccount **must** be returned (1..1)

If the ReadPAN permission is granted by the PSU, the ASPSP may choose to populate the OBReadStandingOrder6/Data/StandingOrder/CreditorAccount/Identification with the unmasked PAN (if the PAN is being populated in the response).
