## Overview

The offers resource is used by an AISP to retrieve the offers available for a specific AccountId or to retrieve the offers detail in bulk for all accounts that the PSU has consented to.

This resource description should be read in conjunction with a compatible Account Information Services API Profile.

## Endpoints

Endpoints for the resource and available methods.

|  |Resource |HTTP Operation |Endpoint |Mandatory? |Scope |Grant Type |Idempotency Key |Parameters |Request Object |Response Object |
| --- |--- |--- |--- |--- |--- |--- |--- |--- |--- |--- |
| 1 |offers |GET |GET /accounts/{AccountId}/offers |Conditional |accounts |Authorization Code |No | Pagination| |OBReadOffer1 |
| 2 |offers |GET |GET /offers |Optional |accounts |Authorization Code |No |Pagination | |OBReadOffer1 |

### GET /accounts/{AccountId}/offers

An AISP  **may**  retrieve the offers resource for a specific AccountId (which is retrieved in the call to GET /accounts).

### GET /offers

If an ASPSP has implemented the bulk retrieval endpoints, an AISP  **may**  optionally retrieve the offers in bulk.
This will retrieve the resources for all authorised accounts linked to the account-request.

## Data Model

The OBReadOffer1 object will be used for the call to:

* GET /accounts/{AccountId}/offers
* GET /offers

### Resource Definition

A resource that contains a set of elements that describes the list of offers available to a specific account (AccountId).

* Generic features (and pricing) for the account product will be not be available via the **offers** resources. These generic features will be available via the **product** resource.
* The outcome of any offer (or product feature) uptake will not be reported via the **offers** resource. The benefits, interest, cash-back for any account will be available via the **statements** resource (if this is available to PSUs in the existing ASPSP online channel).

An account (AccountId) may have no offers available, or may have multiple offers available.

### UML Diagram

### Notes

* Offers (or promotions) for a specific AccountId, which may be viewable in the ASPSP online banking interface, may have a complicated offer structure (which cannot be expressed using a flat Amount, Fee, Rate, or Value structure). In this case, the ASPSP must use the Description field to describe the nature of the offer in free-text

### Permission Codes

The resource requires the ReadOffers permission. The resource response payload does not differ depending on the permissions granted.
