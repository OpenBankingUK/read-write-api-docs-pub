## Overview

The parties resource is used by an AISP to retrieve the details on the account owner(s)/holder(s) and operator(s) for a specific account identified by AccountId. 

The party resource is used by an AISP to retrieve the details on the account owner/holder for a specific account identified by AccountId:

* In the case of a business, this will be the details of the business
* In the case of a joint account, this will be the party that has given authorisation to the AISP to view the account.  

This resource description should be read in conjunction with a compatible Account Information Services API Profile.

## Endpoints
