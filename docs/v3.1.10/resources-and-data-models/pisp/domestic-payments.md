## Overview

The Domestic Payments resource is used by a PISP to initiate a Domestic Payment.

This resource description should be read in conjunction with a compatible Payment Initiation API Profile.

## Endpoints

| Resource |HTTP Operation |Endpoint |Mandatory ? |Scope |Grant Type |Message Signing |Idempotency Key |Request Object |Response Object |
| -------- |-------------- |-------- |----------- |----- |---------- |--------------- |--------------- |-------------- |--------------- |
| domestic-payments |POST |POST /domestic-payments |Mandatory |payments |Authorization Code |Signed Request Signed Response |Yes |OBWriteDomestic2 |OBWriteDomesticResponse5 |
| domestic-payments |GET |GET /domestic-payments/{DomesticPaymentId} |Mandatory |payments |Client Credentials |Signed Response |No |NA |OBWriteDomesticResponse5 |
| payment-details |GET |GET /domestic-payments/{DomesticPaymentId}/payment-details |Optional |payments |Client Credentials |Signed Response |No |NA |OBWritePaymentDetailsResponse1 |

### POST /domestic-payments

Once the domestic-payment-consent has been authorised by the PSU, the PISP can proceed to submitting the domestic-payment for processing:

* This is done by making a POST request to the **domestic-payments** endpoint.
* This request is an instruction to the ASPSP to begin the domestic single immediate payment journey. The domestic payment must be submitted immediately, however, there are some scenarios where the domestic payment may not be executed immediately (e.g., busy periods at the ASPSP).
* The PISP **must** ensure that the Initiation and Risk sections of the domestic-payment match the corresponding Initiation and Risk sections of the domestic-payment-consent resource. If the two do not match, the ASPSP must not process the request and **must** respond with a 400 (Bad Request).
* Any operations on the domestic-payment resource will not result in a status change for the domestic-payment resource.

#### Status

A domestic-payment can only be created if its corresponding domestic-payment-consent resource has the status of "Authorised". 

The domestic-payment resource that is created successfully must have one of the following PaymentStatusCode code-set enumerations:

| Status |
| ------ |
| Pending |
| Rejected |
| AcceptedSettlementInProcess |
| AcceptedSettlementCompleted |
| AcceptedWithoutPosting |
| AcceptedCreditSettlementCompleted |

### GET /domestic-payments/{DomesticPaymentId}

A PISP can retrieve the domestic-payment to check its status.

#### Status

The domestic-payment resource must have one of the following PaymentStatusCode code-set enumerations:

| Status |
| ------ |
| Pending |
| Rejected |
| AcceptedSettlementInProcess |
| AcceptedSettlementCompleted |
| AcceptedWithoutPosting |
| AcceptedCreditSettlementCompleted |

### GET /domestic-payments/{DomesticPaymentId}/payment-details

A PISP can retrieve the Details of the underlying payment transaction via this endpoint. This resource allows ASPSPs to return richer list of Payment Statuses, and if available payment scheme related statuses.

#### Status

The domestic-payment - payment-details must have one of the following PaymentStatusCode code-set enumerations:

| Status |
| ------ |
| Accepted |
| AcceptedCancellationRequest |
| AcceptedTechnicalValidation |
| AcceptedCustomerProfile |
| AcceptedFundsChecked |
| AcceptedWithChange |
| Pending |
| Rejected |

### State Model

#### Payment Order

The state model for the domestic-payment resource follows the behaviour and definitions for the ISO 20022 PaymentStatusCode code-set.

![Payment Order Status](./images/PaymentStatusLifeCycle.png)

The definitions for the status:

|  |Status |Payment Status Description |
|--|------ |-------------------------- |
| 1 |Pending |Payment initiation or individual transaction included in the payment initiation is pending. Further checks and status update will be performed. |
| 2 |Rejected |Payment initiation or individual transaction included in the payment initiation has been rejected. |
| 3 |AcceptedSettlementInProcess |All preceding checks such as technical validation and customer profile were successful and therefore the payment initiation has been accepted for execution. |
| 4 |AcceptedSettlementCompleted |Settlement on the debtor's account has been completed. |
| 5 |AcceptedWithoutPosting |Payment instruction included in the credit transfer is accepted without being posted to the creditor customerâ€™s account. |
| 6 |AcceptedCreditSettlementCompleted |Settlement on the creditor's account has been completed.|

##### Multiple Authorisation

If the payment-order requires multiple authorisations - the Status of the multiple authorisations will be updated in the MultiAuthorisation object.

![Multi Authorisation Status](./images/image2018-6-29_16-36-34.png)

The definitions for the status:

|  |Status |Status Description |
|-- |------ |------------------ |
| 1 |AwaitingFurtherAuthorisation |The payment-order resource is awaiting further authorisation. |
| 2 |Rejected |The payment-order resource has been rejected by an authoriser. |
| 3 |Authorised |The payment-order resource has been successfully authorised by all required authorisers.|
