## Overview

The International Payment Consent resource is used by a PISP to register an intent to initiate an International Payment.

This resource description should be read in conjunction with a compatible Payment Initiation API Profile.

## Endpoints

| Resource |HTTP Operation |Endpoint |Mandatory ? |Scope |Grant Type |Message Signing |Idempotency Key |Request Object |Response Object |
| -------- |-------------- |-------- |----------- |----- |---------- |--------------- |--------------- |-------------- |--------------- |
| international-payment-consents |POST |POST /international-payment-consents |Conditional |payments |Client Credentials |Signed Request Signed Response |Yes |OBWriteInternationalConsent5 |OBWriteInternationalConsentResponse6 |
| international-payment-consents |GET |GET /international-payment-consents/{ConsentId} |Mandatory (if resource POST implemented) |payments |Client Credentials |Signed Response |No |NA |OBWriteInternationalConsentResponse6 |
| international-payment-consents |GET |GET /international-payment-consents/{ConsentId}/funds-confirmation |Mandatory (if resource POST implemented) |payments |Authorization Code |Signed Response |No |NA |OBWriteFundsConfirmationResponse1 |

### POST /international-payment-consents

The API endpoint allows the PISP to ask an ASPSP to create a new **international-payment-consent** resource.

* The POST action indicates to the ASPSP that a payment consent has been staged. At this point, the PSU may not have been identified by the ASPSP, and the request payload may not contain any information of the account that should be debited.
* The endpoint allows the PISP to send a copy of the consent (between PSU and PISP) to the ASPSP for the PSU to authorise.
* The ASPSP creates the **international-payment-consent** resource and responds with a unique ConsentId to refer to the resource.

#### Status

The default Status is "AwaitingAuthorisation" immediately after the international-payment-consent has been created.

| Status |
| --- |
| AwaitingAuthorisation |

## GET /international-payment-consents/{ConsentId}

A PISP can optionally retrieve a payment consent resource that they have created to check its status.

#### Status

Once the PSU authorises the payment-consent resource, the Status of the payment-consent resource will be updated with "Authorised".

If the PSU rejects the consent or the international-payment-consent has failed some other ASPSP validation, the Status will be set to "Rejected".

Once an international-payment has been successfully created using the international-payment-consent, the Status of the international-payment-consent will be set to "Consumed".

The available Status codes for the international-payment-consent resource are:

| Status |
| --- |
| AwaitingAuthorisation |
| Rejected |
| Authorised |
| Consumed |

### GET /international-payment-consents/{ConsentId}/funds-confirmation

The API endpoint allows the PISP to ask an ASPSP to confirm funds on an **international-payment-consent** resource.

* An ASPSP can only respond to a funds confirmation request if the **international-payment-consent** resource has an `Authorised` status. If the status is not `Authorised`, an ASPSP **must** respond with a 400 (Bad Request) and a `UK.OBIE.Resource.InvalidConsentStatus` error code.
* Confirmation of funds requests do not affect the status of the **international-payment-consent** resource.

### State Model

#### Payment Order Consent

The state model for the international-payment-consent resource follows the generic consent state model. However, does not use the "Revoked" status, as the consent for an international-payment is not a long-lived consent.

![Payment Order Consent State Model](./images/image2018-5-18_10-24-21.png)

The definitions for the Status:

| | Status | Status Description |
| --- |------ |------------------ |
| 1 |AwaitingAuthorisation |The consent resource is awaiting PSU authorisation. |
| 2 |Rejected |The consent resource has been rejected. |
| 3 |Authorised |The consent resource has been successfully authorised. |
| 4 |Consumed |The consented action has been successfully completed. This does not reflect the status of the consented action. |

## Data Model

The data dictionary section gives the detail on the payload content for the International Payment API flows.

### Reused Classes

#### OBInternational3

This section describes the OBInternational3 class which is reused as the Initiation object in the international-payment-consent resource.

##### UML Diagram

![OB International Reusable class](./images/OBInternational3.svg)

##### Notes

For the OBInternational3 Initiation object: 

* All elements in the Initiation payload that are specified by the PISP, must not be changed via the ASPSP as this is part of formal consent from the PSU.
* If the ASPSP is able to establish a problem with payload or any contextual error during the API call, the ASPSP must reject the international-payment-consent request immediately.
* If the ASPSP establishes a problem with the international-payment-consent after the API call, the ASPSP must set the Status of the international-payment-consent resource to Rejected.
* DebtorAccount is **optional** as the PISP may not know the account identification details for the PSU.
* If the DebtorAccount is specified by the PISP and is invalid for the PSU, then the international-payment-consent will be set to Rejected after PSU authentication.
* CreditorAgent must at least have either of the pairs provided: Scheme Name and Identification or Name and Postal Address.
* Account Identification field usage:
  * Where "UK.OBIE.SortCodeAccountNumber" is specified as the SchemeName in the Account Identification Section (either DebtorAccount or CreditorAccount), the Identification field **must** be populated with the 6 digit Sort Code and 8 digit Account Number (a 14 digit field).
  * Where the "UK.OBIE.IBAN" is specified as the SchemeName in the Account Identification Section (either DebtorAccount or CreditorAccount), the Identification field **must** be populated with the full IBAN.
* LocalInstrument is the requested payment scheme for execution. This is a free-text field.
* InstructionPrioirty may be used by the ASPSP to determine the payment scheme for execution.
* The InstructedAmount object must be populated with the desired Amount and Currency of transfer, regardless of the currency of the DebtorAccount or CreditorAccount. I.e., a PSU may wish to transfer 100EUR from a GBP DebtorAccount (InstructedAmount will be 100EUR), or 100GBP to an EUR CreditorAccount (the InstructedAmount will be 100GBP).
* The CurrencyOfTransfer is used to specify the currency the funds will be transferred. I.e., a PSU may wish to transfer 100USD from a GBP DebtorAccount to a Rupee INR CreditorAccount in India.
* The ChargeBearer field is used by the PISP to indicate the bearer of charges. An ASPSP must reject the request if the requested charge allocation cannot be fulfilled.

The OBInternational3/ExchangeRateInformation object must conform to these behaviours:

* A PISP must specify the DebtorAccount currency in the UnitCurrency field if the PISP is requesting a specific RateType so the ASPSP can respond with an exchange rate quote prior to PSU authorisation.
* A PISP may indicate an exchange rate request using the RateType with these enumerations:
  * Actual.
  * Agreed.
  * Indicative.
* A PISP must specify ExchangeRate and ContractIdentification when requesting an **Agreed** RateType. If an invalid ContractIdentification and ExchangeRate are requested together, an ASPSP must reject the request.
  * For an "Agreed" RateType a requested exchange rate is populated in the ExchangeRate field, against the UnitCurrency. I.e, if the UnitCurrency is GBP and CurrencyOfTransfer is USD, then ExchangeRate will be 1.34 (USD to 1 GBP).
  * For an "Agreed" RateType the exchange rate contract identifier is populated in the ContractIdentification field.
* A PISP must not specify ExchangeRate and/or ContractIdentification when requesting an **Actual** RateType.
* A PISP must not specify ExchangeRate and/or ContractIdentification when requesting an **Indicative** RateType.

#### UML Diagram

![International Payment Consent - Response](./images/OBWriteInternationalConsentResponse6.svg)

#### Notes 

The international-payment-consent **response** contains the full **original** payload from the international-payment-consent **request** with the additional elements below:

* ConsentId.
* CreationDateTime the international-payment-consent resource was created.
* Status and StatusUpdateDateTime of the international-payment-consent resource.
* CutOffDateTime Behaviour is explained in Payment Initiation API Profile, Section - [Payment Restrictions -> CutOffDateTime Behaviour](../../profiles/payment-initiation-api-profile.md#cutoffdatetime-behaviour).
* ExpectedExecutionDateTime for the international-payment resource if created before CutOffDateTIme - the expected DateTime the payment is executed against the Debtor Account. If populated, the ASPSP must update the value with any changes (e.g., after PSU authorisation).
* ExpectedSettlementDateTime for the international-payment resource if created before CutOffDateTIme - the expected DateTime the payment will be received at the Creditor Account. If populated, the ASPSP must update the value with any changes (e.g., after PSU authorisation).
* Charges array which will be used by the ASPSP to indicate charges, and the ChargeBearer as relevant.
* Post successful PSU Authentication, an ASPSP may provide `Debtor/Name` in the Payment Order Consent Response, even when the Payer didn't provide the Debtor Account via PISP.
* ExchangeRateInformation (the ASPSP response) - this object will be used to communicate exchange rate information back to the PISP. It must be consistent with what is requested in the Initiation object from the PISP.

Exchange rate behaviour:

* For an **Agreed** RateType - if an ASPSP chooses to respond with Data/ExchangeRateInformation object:
  * An ASPSP may respond with the same requested exchange rate in the Data/ExchangeRateInformation object.
  * An ASPSP must not populate Data/ExchangeRateInformation/ExpirationDateTime.
* For an **Actual** RateType - if an ASPSP chooses to respond with Data/ExchangeRateInformation object:
  * An ASPSP must respond with an actual quote in the Data/ExchangeRateInformation object.
  * An ASPSP must respond with an actual ExchangeRate quote.
  * An ASPSP must respond with an ExpirationDateTime.
  * An ASPSP must reject the international-payment request if the PISP does not submit the international-payment within the ExchangeRateInformation/ExpirationDateTime.
* For an **Indicative** RateType - if an ASPSP chooses to respond with Data/ExchangeRateInformation object:
  * An ASPSP must respond with an indicative quote in the Data/ExchangeRateInformation object.
  * An ASPSP must respond with an indicative ExchangeRate quote.
  * An ASPSP must not populate Data/ExchangeRateInformation/ExpirationDateTime for the exchange rate, as it is the market rate on the date of execution (date on which the DebtorAccount is debited).
