## Overview

The Payment Initiation API Profile describes the flows and common functionality for the Payment Initiation API, which allows a Payment Initiation Service Provider ('PISP') to:

- Register an intent to **stage** a payment-order consent.
- Optionally confirm available funds for a payment-order
  - Domestic immediate, international immediate and international scheduled (immediate debit) payments only.
- Subsequently **submit** the payment-order for processing.
- Optionally retrieve the status of a payment-order **consent** or payment-order **resource**.

This profile should be read in conjunction with a compatible Read/Write Data API Profile which provides a description of the elements that are common across all the Read/Write Data APIs, and compatible individual resources.

### Document Overview

This document consists of the following parts:

 **Overview:** Provides an overview of the profile.

 **Basics:** Identifies the flows, restrictions and release management.

 **Security & Access Control:** Specifies the means for PISPs and PSUs to authenticate themselves and provide consent.

 **Data Model:** Documents mappings and enumerations that apply to all the end-points.

 **Alternative Flows:** Documents rules for alternative flows.

### Resources

Each of the Payment Initiation API resources are documented in the  [Resources and Data Models/PISP](../resources-and-data-models/pisp/README.md) area of the specification. Each resource is documented with:

- Endpoints
  - The API endpoints available for the resource.
- Data Model
  - Resource definition.
  - UML diagram.
  - Permissions as they relate to accessing the resource.
  - Data dictionary - which defines fields, re-usable classes, mandatory (1..1) or conditional (0..1) as defined in the Design Principles section, and enumerations.
- Usage Examples

### Design Principles

#### Scheme Agnostic

The API has been be designed so that it is agnostic to the underlying payment scheme that is responsible for carrying out the payment.

In doing so, this means we will not design field lengths and payloads to only match the Faster Payments message, and will instead rely on the field lengths and definitions in ISO 20022. Due diligence has been carried out to ensure that the API has the necessary fields to function with Bacs payments as per the agreed scope.

Further mapping guidance has been provided to ensure that differences are understood between the Open Banking Payment API standard, and other message formats in the Domestic Payment Message Formats sub-page.

#### Status Codes

The API uses two status codes that serve two different purposes:

- The HTTP Status Code reflects the outcome of the API call (the HTTP operation on the resource).
- The Status field for the payment-order consent reflects the status of the PSU consent authorisation.
- The Status field for the payment-order resource reflects the status of the payment-order initiation or execution.

## Basics

### Overview

The figure below provides a **general** outline of a payment flow for all payment-order types using the Payment APIs. The payment-order types covered in this profile include:

- Domestic payments.
- Domestic scheduled payments.
- Domestic standing orders.
- International payments.
- International scheduled payments.

The payment-order consent and payment-order resource in the following flow generalises for the different payment-order types. e.g. for a domestic payment, the payment-order consent resource is domestic-payment-consents; and the payment-order resource is domestic-payments.

![Payments Flow](./images/PaymentStatusModelTriangle.png)

#### Steps

Step 1: Agree Payment-Order Initiation

- This flow begins with a PSU consenting to a payment being made. The consent is between the PSU and the PISP.
- The debtor account details can optionally be specified at this stage.

Step 2: Setup Payment-Order Consent

- The PISP connects to the ASPSP that services the PSU's payment account and creates a new **payment-order consent** resource. This informs the ASPSP that one of its PSUs intends to make a **payment-order**. The ASPSP responds with an identifier for the payment-order consent resource (the ConsentId, which is the intent identifier).
- This step is carried out by making a **POST** request to the **payment-order consent** resource.

Step 3: Authorise Consent

- The PISP requests the PSU to authorise the consent. The ASPSP may carry this out by using a *redirection flow* or a *decoupled flow*.
  - In a redirection flow, the PISP redirects the PSU to the ASPSP.
    - The redirect includes the ConsentId generated in the previous step.
    - This allows the ASPSP to correlate the payment order consent that was setup.
    - The ASPSP authenticates the PSU.
    - The PSU selects the debtor account at this stage (if it has not been previously specified in Step 1).
    - The ASPSP updates the state of the payment order consent resource internally to indicate that the consent has been authorised.
    - Once the consent has been authorised, the PSU is redirected back to the PISP.
  - In a decoupled flow, the ASPSP requests the PSU to authorise consent on an  *authentication device* that is separate from the  *consumption device* on which the PSU is interacting with the PISP.
    - The decoupled flow is initiated by the PISP calling a back-channel authorisation request.
    - The request contains a 'hint' that identifies the PSU paired with the consent to be authorised.
    - The ASPSP authenticates the PSU
    - The PSU selects the debtor account at this stage (if it has not been previously specified in Step 1)
    - The ASPSP updates the state of the payment order consent resource internally to indicate that the consent has been authorised.
    - Once the consent has been authorised, the ASPSP can make a callback to the PISP to provide an access token.

Step 4: Confirm Funds (Domestic and International Single Immediate Payments Only)

- Once the PSU is authenticated and authorised the **payment-order-consent** , the PISP can check whether funds are available to make the payment.
- This is carried out by making a **GET** request, calling the **funds-confirmation** operator on the **payment-order-consent** resource.

Step 5: Create Payment-Order

- The PISP creates a **payment-order** resource to indicate that the payment created in the steps above should be submitted for processing.
- This is carried out by making a **POST** request to the appropriate **payment-order** resource.
- The ASPSP returns the identifier for the payment-order resource to the PISP.

Step 6: Get Consent/Payment-Order/Payment-Details Status

- The PISP can check the status of the payment-order consent (with the ConsentId) or payment-order resource (with the payment-order resource identifier) or payment-details(with the payment-order resource identifier) .
- This is carried out by making a **GET** request to the **payment-order consent** or **payment-order** or **payment-details** resource.

### Payment Restrictions

The standard does not provide a uniform set of restrictions for payment-order types that can be supported through this API.

For example, but not limited to:

- The maximum InstructedAmount allowable.
- The domestic-standing-order Frequency patterns supported.
- The maximum future date on a scheduled-payment.

Each ASPSP **must** determine appropriate restrictions that they support based on their individual practices, standards and limitations. These restrictions should be documented on ASPSP developer portals.

An ASPSP **must** reject the payment-order **consent** if the ASPSP is unable to handle the request.

#### CutOffDateTime Behaviour

An ASPSP **may** return the specific CutOffDateTime when responding to a payment-order consent request.

An ASPSP **must** document the behaviour for a payment receipt before and after the CutOffDateTime for a payment-order has elapsed.

Two strategies for handling behaviour are:

- Reject the payment-order (and steps associated with the creation of payment-order) if received after the applicable CutOffDateTime
- Accept the payment-order (and steps associated with the creation of payment-order) if received after the applicable CutOffDateTime

#####  Reject the Payment-Order

In this scenario, the behaviour of payment-order execution is explicit to the PISP and PSU.

- An ASPSP **must** reject the payment-order **consent** if the CutOffDateTime for a specific payment-order type has elapsed.
- An ASPSP **must** reject an authorization request when the underlying intent object is associated with a CutoffDateTime that has elapsed. The ASPSP **must not** issue an access token in such a situation. The ASPSP **must** set the status of the payment-order consent resource to “Rejected”.
- An ASPSP **must** reject the payment-order **resource** if the CutOffDateTime for a specific payment-order type, has been established and has elapsed.
- A PISP **must** ensure that the PSU consent authorisation is completed and the payment-order resource is created before the CutOffDateTime elapses.

For a payment-order **consent** or a payment-order **resource** that has been rejected due to the elapsed CutoffDateTime, the PISP **may** decide to create a corresponding schedule payment endpoint to create a new payment-order consent. E.g. if a PISP attempts to make a BACS payment after 16:00, it would be rejected. The PISP may use the /domestic-scheduled-payment-consents endpoint to create a consent for the same payment for the next working day.

##### Accept the Payment-Order

In this scenario, the behaviour of the payment-order execution is not explicit to the PISP and PSU, and the payment-order will be executed on the next available working day.

- An ASPSP **must** accept the payment-order **consent** if the CutOffDateTime for a specific payment-order type has elapsed.
- An ASPSP **must** accept an authorization request when the underlying intent object is associated with a CutoffDateTime that has elapsed.
- An ASPSP **must** accept the payment-order **resource** if the CutOffDateTime for a specific payment-order type, has been established and has elapsed.
- An ASPSP **may** update the payment-order consent or payment-order **resource** with the CutOffDateTime, ExpectedExecutionDateTime and ExpectedSettlementDateTime, to communicate expected execution behaviour  if the CutOffDateTime has elapsed.

### Release Management

This section overviews the release management and versioning strategy for the Payment Initiation API. It applies to all Payment Order Consent and Payment Order resources, specified in the Endpoints section.

#### Payment-Order Consent

##### POST

- A PISP **must not** create a payment-order consent ConsentId on a newer version and use it to create a payment-order resource in a previous version
  - E.g., A ConsentId created in v3, must not be used to create a v1 PaymentSubmissionId
- A PISP **must not** create a payment-order consent ConsentId on a previous version and use it to create a payment-order resource in a newer version
  - E.g., A PaymentId created in v1, must not be used to create a v3 DomesticPaymentId

##### GET

- A PISP **must not** access a payment-order ConsentId created in a newer version, via a previous version endpoint
  - E.g., A ConsentId created in v3 accessed via a v1 PaymentId
- An ASPSP **may** choose to make ConsentIds accessible across versions
  - E.g., for a PaymentId created in v1, an ASPSP may or may not make it available via v3, as this is a short-lived consent

#### Payment-Order Consent (Confirm Funds)

##### GET

- A PISP **must not** confirm funds using a payment-order-consent ConsentId created in a different version.
  - E.g. A ConsentId created in v3, must not be used to confirm funds on a v1 endpoint.

#### Payment-Order Resource

##### POST

- A PISP **must** use a payment-order consent ConsentId within the same version to create the payment-order resource (in that version)
  - E.g., A v3 payment-order **consent** can only be used to create a payment-order **resource** in v3.
- An ASPSP **must not** allow a PISP to use a ConsentId from a previous version to create a Payment Order in a newer version, and vice versa

##### GET

- A PISP **must** refer to the ASPSP's online Developer Portal for guidelines on accessibility of a payment-order resource in a newer version

- A PISP **must** not access the payment-order resource types introduced in a newer version, on an older version endpoint:
  - E.g., an international-payment created in v3, that is accessed via the v1 payment-submissions endpoint.
- A PISP **must** not access the payment-order resource created in a newer version on an older version endpoint:
  - E.g., for a domestic-payment resource created in v3, access via the v1 payment-submissions endpoint is not permitted.
- An ASPSP **must** document the behaviour on the accessibility of a payment-order resource in a newer version on the ASPSP's online Developer Portal.
- An ASPSP **must** allow access to the payment-order resource created in a previous version on a newer version endpoint (depending on an ASPSP's legal requirement for data retention):
  - E.g., a payment-submission created in v1, must be accessible as a v3 domestic-payment, with sensible defaults for additional fields introduced in v3 (e.g., if an ASPSP must make payment resources available for 7 years).
- In the case where a payment-order type is the same, but the structure has changed in a newer version, sensible defaults may be used, with the ASPSP's Developer Portal clearly specifying the behaviour.
  - E.g., a new field StatusUpdateDateTime was introduced in v3, an ASPSPs must populate this with the last status update time (as the StatusUpdateDateTime is a mandatory field).

## Security & Access Control

### Scopes

The access tokens required for accessing the Payment APIs must have at least the following scope:

```
payments: Generic payment scope
```

### Grants Types

PISPs **must** use a client credentials grant to obtain a token to make POST requests to the payment-order **consent** endpoints. In the specification, this grant type is referred to as "Client Credentials".

PISPs **must** use an authorization code grant using a redirect or decoupled flow to obtain a token to make POST requests to the payment-order **resource** endpoints. This token may also be used to confirm funds on a payment-order **consent** resource. In the specification, this grant type is referred to as "Authorization Code".

PISPs **must** use a client credentials grant to obtain a token to make GET requests (excluding confirming funds).

### Consent Authorisation

OAuth 2.0 scopes are coarse-grained and the set of available scopes are defined at the point of client registration. There is no standard method for specifying and enforcing fine-grained scopes e.g., a scope to enforce payments of a specified amount on a specified date.

A  *consent authorisation* is used to define the fine-grained scope that is granted by the PSU to the PISP.

The PISP **must** begin a payment-order request by creating a **payment-order consent** resource through a **POST** operation. These resources indicate the  _consent_ that the PISP claims it has been given by the PSU. At this stage, the consent is not yet authorised as the ASPSP has not yet verified this claim with the PSU.

The ASPSP responds with a ConsentId. This is the intent-id that is used when initiating the authorization code grant (as described in the Trust Framework).

As part of the authorization code grant:

- The ASPSP authenticates the PSU.
- The ASPSP plays back the consent (registered by the PISP) back to the PSU to get consent authorisation. The PSU may accept or reject the consent in its entirety (but not selectively).
- If the consent did not indicate a debtor account the ASPSP presents the PSU with a list of accounts from which the PSU may select one.

Once these steps are complete, the consent is considered to have been authorised by the PSU.

#### Multiple Authorisation

In a multiple authorisation context, the same consent authorisation steps are followed for the first PSU to authorise or stage the payment-order consent.

In the payment-order consent:

- A PISP **may** request an AuthorisationType for the payment-order (i.e., Single or Any). If a value is not provided, an ASPSP will interpret the AuthorisationType as 'Any'.
- A PISP **may** request a CompletionDateTime for the payment-order authorisation to be complete. If a value is not provided, an ASPSP will interpret the CompletionDateTime as unbounded.
- An ASPSP **must** reject the payment-order consent if the AuthorisationType requested by the PISP does not match the DebtorAccount in the request.
- An ASPSP **must** set the status of the payment-order consent to Rejected, if the AuthorisationType requested by the PISP cannot be satisfied, after PSU Authentication:
  - The ASPSP must respond back with an OAuth error response fields  _**error**_ specified as invalid_request and _**error_description**_ containing an appropriate message.
- An ASPSP **must** restrict the selection of DebtorAccount (in the ASPSP online channel) to accounts that match the AuthorisationType requested by the PISP.

In the payment-order resource:

- An ASPSP **must** respond with the MultiAuthorisation object if the payment-order requires multiple authorisations. The MultiAuthorisation object indicates to the PISP that the payment-order requires multiple authorisations.
- The ASPSP **must** populate the MultiAuthorisation object with the Status of the multiple authorisaitons.
- The ASPSP **may** populate the MultiAuthorisation object with additional details of the multiple authorisation journey including:
  - The number of required authorisations (total required at the start of the multi authorisation journey).
  - The number of authorisations complete.
  - The date and time of the last authorisation update.
  - The date and time that the authorisation flow must be completed.

Once the final authorisation is received by the ASPSP, the ASPSP **may** notify the PISP that the payment-order resource has been fully Authorised using an Event Notification (as described in the Event Notification API Profile and Resources).

#### Error Condition

If the PSU does not complete a successful consent authorisation (e.g., if the PSU has not authenticated successfully), the authorization code grant ends with a redirection to the TPP with an error response as described in [RFC 6749 Section 4.1.2.1](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-4.1.2.1). The PSU is redirected to the TPP with an error parameter indicating the error that occurred.

#### Consent Revocation

A PSU cannot revoke a payment-order consent once it has been authorized.

This is required to comply with Article 80 of PSD2.

#### Changes to Selected Account

For a payment-order consent, the selected debtor account cannot be changed once the consent has been authorized.

#### Consent Re-authentication

Payment consents are short-lived and cannot be re-authenticated by the PSU.

### Risk Scoring Information

During the design workshops, ASPSPs articulated a need to perform risk scoring on the payments initiated via the Payment API.

Information for risk scoring and assessment will come via:

- FAPI HTTP headers. These are defined in [Section 6.3](http://openid.net/specs/openid-financial-api-part-1-wd-02.html#client-provisions) of the FAPI specification and in the Headers section above.
- Additional fields identified by the industry as business logic security concerns which will be passed in the Risk section of the payload in the JSON object as defined `OBRisk*` components.

These fields are documented further in the Data Payload section.

## Data Model

### Reused Classes

#### OBRisk1

This section describes the Risk1 class which is reused in the payment-order consent and payment-order resources.

### Identifier Fields

This section describes the identifiers used through the Payment API flows, the direction of flow through the system, and how they are used.

The standard definitions for the elements in the API payloads are described in the Data Payload section. However, this table gives further detail on the business meaning, and how they are used.

| Generated |Identifier |Business Description |
| --- |--- |--- |
| Merchant/PISP Sent in API Payload |EndToEndIdentification |The EndToEndIdentification reference is a reference that can be populated by the debtor (or merchant in the ecommerce space). This reference is important to the debtor (could be an internal reference Id against the transaction), it Is NOT the reference information that will be primarily populated on the statement of the creditor (beneficiary). |
| Merchant/PISP Sent in API Payload |InstructionIdentification |The PISP generates the InstructionIdentification which is a unique transaction Id and passes it to the ASPSP (this is mandatory), but this does not have to go any further in the payment flow. The flow of this identifier needs to align with payment scheme rules.<br><br>The expectation is that this is unique indefinitely across all time periods. The PISP can ensure this is indefinitely unique by including a date or date time element to the field, or by inserting a unique Id. |
| Merchant/PISP Sent in API Payload |RemittanceInformation |The RemittanceInformation is the reference information that the creditor (or beneficiary) will need to reconcile (e.g. Invoice 123). |
| ASPSP / API System |ConsentId |A unique identification as assigned by the ASPSP to uniquely identify the payment-order consent resource. |
| ASPSP / API System |Payment Order Id |Anique identification as assigned by the ASPSP to uniquely identify the payment-order resource.<br><br><li>DomesticPaymentId</li><li>DomesticScheduledPaymentId</li><li>DomesticStandingOrderId</li><li>InternationalPaymentId</li><li>InternationalScheduledPaymentId</li> |
| ASPSP / Payment Scheme |Scheme Payment ID |This is generated by the ASPSP to uniquely identify a payment through a processing scheme. In the case of FPS, this is the FPID. |

The tables below identify the actor that initially creates each of the message identifiers and their transmission and visibility to other actors.

These flows are indicative and will be dependent on what payment schemes or agencies are able to support.

Key:

- O indicates the actor that creates the identifier.
- **=>** downstream direction of flow
- **<=** upstream direction of flow

### Reject the Payment Order Consent Creation After CutOffDateTime

This example illustrates a scenario where an ASPSP choses to Reject the Payment-Order consent/resource request, after the CutoffTime. We have a CHAPS payment-order consent created after the CutOffDateTime, and ASPSP rejects the Consent, and the PISP chooses to place a Scheduled Payment-Order consent.

### Reject the Payment Order Creation After CutOffDateTime

This example illustrates a scenario where an ASPSP choses to Reject the Payment-Order consent/resource request, after the CutoffTime. We have a CHAPS payment-order Consent created and the Authorisation completed before the CutOffDateTime, but the Payment-Order submission happened after the CutOffDateTime, so the ASPSP has rejected it.
