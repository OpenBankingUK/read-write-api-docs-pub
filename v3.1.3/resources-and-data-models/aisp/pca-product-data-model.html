id="overview"><a href="#overview" class="header-anchor">#</a> Overview</h2> <p>From the analysis:-</p> <ul><li>Most banks (other than CMA9) simply have to supply the MMC for their PCA products (on-sale, negotiated or back book).</li> <li>The MMC is the CMA's attempt to come up with a core fee/charge that can be used for PCA product comparison purposes.</li> <li>This, in combination, with representative rates (AER for Credit Interest, EAR for overdrafts) would allow a customer to reasonably compare PCA products.</li> <li>PCA Marketing state information is not required.</li> <li>Eligibility criteria met when the PCA was sold is unlikely to be reliable. Hence eligibility criteria information is not required.</li></ul> <p>Further analysis required:-</p> <ul><li>FeaturesAndBenefits: Further analysis is required to check whether the features and benefits section is needed.</li></ul> <h3 id="fields-to-include-in-pca-product"><a href="#fields-to-include-in-pca-product" class="header-anchor">#</a> Fields to include in PCA Product</h3> <table><thead><tr><th>Product Section</th> <th>Fields to be included</th></tr></thead> <tbody><tr><td>PCA (We'll rename this &quot;Product&quot; and merge PCA and CoreProduct attributes)</td> <td><li>Name </li><li>Open Data Product ID (Mandatory, if product info is available on Open Data PCA API) </li><li>ProductType (&quot;PCA&quot;) </li><li>MonthlyMaximumCharge (Mandatory for &quot;front book&quot; products)</li></td></tr> <tr><td>CoreProduct</td> <td><strong>None</strong> - Will be merged in to new &quot;Product&quot; section.</td></tr> <tr><td>PCAMarketingState</td> <td><strong>None</strong> - Sections will only include current state information, so this section is not required</td></tr> <tr><td>CreditInterest</td> <td><li>TierBandSet fields (excluding credit interest eligibility). </li><li>All TierBand fields <br><strong>Note:</strong> Only current state credit interest information is required.</li></td></tr> <tr><td>Overdraft</td> <td><li> All TierBandSet fields (including OverdraftFeesAndCharges) </li><li> All TierBand fields (including OverdraftFeesAndCharges). <br><strong>Note:</strong> Only current state information is required.</li></td></tr> <tr><td>Eligibility</td> <td><strong>None</strong> - Eligibility criteria met when PCA was sold unlikely to be reliable.</td></tr> <tr><td>FeaturesAndBenefits</td> <td><strong>None</strong> - The value of a particular feature and benefit to an accountholder is dependent on their use of that benefit and whether they met eligibility criteria.

Net is usually determined by removing basic rate tax only, and banks stopped doing this from April 2016. This may still be required for backbook products.</li> <li>It has been ensured that both the calculation and application frequency for credit interest is captured.
<ul><li>The term &quot;Nominal&quot; used by some banks is synonymous with &quot;Gross&quot;.</li></ul></li> <li>DepositInterestAppliedCoverage refers to which interest rate is applied when interests are tiered. For example, if an account balance is £2k and the interest tiers are:- 0-£500 0.1%, 500-1000 0.2%, 1000-10000 0.5%, then the applicable interest rate could either be 0.5% of the entire balance (since the account balance sits in the top interest tier) or (0.1%*500)+(0.2%*500)+(0.5%*1000). In the 1st situation, the interest should be applied to the &quot;Whole&quot; of the account balance and in the 2nd, this should be &quot;Tiered&quot;.</li> <li>Destination refers to whether the Product allows interest to be credited to another account (&quot;PayAway&quot;) or only to itself (&quot;SelfCredit&quot;).</li></ul> <p><img src="images/PCA/PCACreditInterestClassDiagram.png" alt=" images/PCA/PCACreditInterestClassDiagram.png "></p> <h4 id="overdraft"><a href="#overdraft" class="header-anchor">#</a> Overdraft</h4> <ul><li>Overdraft Types can either be committed: The banks are committed to provide this overdraft facility and cannot demand repayment without notifying the customer, or OnDemand : The bank can demand instant repayment of this overdraft.</li> <li>Student Account: Can it be negotiated or back book product?</li> <li>OverdraftFeeCharges are defined at TierBandSet level for fees/charges that are not tiered and at the TierBand level for those that are.</li></ul> <p><img src="images/PCA/PCAOverdraftClassDiagram.png" alt=" PCAOverdraftClassDiagram.png "></p> <h4 id="overdraftfeecharges"><a href="#overdraftfeecharges" class="header-anchor">#</a> OverdraftFeeCharges</h4> <ul><li>A cap can be applied to 1 or more Overdraft Fees/Charges and are typically capped for a particular period e.g. Total overdraft charges (Arranged, Unarranged, Paid Transaction, Unpaid Transaction) may be capped on a monthly basis. More than one fee charges can be clubbed to be capped into one cap. Also a fee charge can be clubbed or used in more than one caps?</li> <li>Capping can either be based on an amount (in gbp), an amount (in items) or a rate.</li> <li>We will need notes to make it clear how any formula used to apply the capping is deduced.</li> <li>FeeCapOccurrence has been added to capture situations where fee/charges are captured dependent on the number of occurrences rather than capped at a particular amount.</li> <li>OverdraftControlIndicator has been added to the OverdraftFeeChargeCap &amp; OverdraftFeeChargeDetail to allow fees &amp; caps to be specified for the overdraft control feature/benefit.</li></ul> <h4 id="otherfeecharges"><a href="#otherfeecharges" class="header-anchor">#</a> OtherFeeCharges</h4> <ul><li>Other fee charges such as Service charge, Monthly Account Maintenance Fee or Service Charge - Account Fee.</li></ul> <p><img src="images/PCA/ainfopca.2.2.0.OtherFeesCharges.png" alt=" ainfopca.2.2.0.OtherFeesCharges.png "></p> <h2 id="data-model"><a href="#data-model" class="header-anchor">#</a> Data Model</h2> <h3 id="data-payload"><a href="#data-payload" class="header-anchor">#</a> Data Payload</h3> <h4 id="pca"><a href="#pca" class="header-anchor">#</a> PCA</h4> <h5 id="uml-class-diagram"><a href="#uml-class-diagram" class="header-anchor">#</a> UML Class Diagram</h5> <ul><li>This implementation is based on the assumption that all pending decisions were based on the OBIE recommended option.</li> <li>Other Fee Charges: Only Periodic Fee(service charge) has been included in the Code List.</li> <li>We have taken Open Data PCA Segments for PCA Account Info as well.</li></ul> <p><img src="images/PCA/ainfopca.2.2.0.ClassDiagram.png" alt=" ainfopca.2.2.0.ClassDiagram.png "></p> <h5 id="data-dictionary"><a href="#data-dictionary" class="header-anchor">#</a> Data Dictionary</h5> <ul><li><a href="productdatafiles/ainfopca.v3.1.2.DD.xlsx">PCA Account Info Data Definition</a></li></ul> <h3 id="data-payload-enumerations"><a href="#data-payload-enumerations" class="header-anchor">#</a> Data Payload - Enumerations</h3> <ul><li><a href="productdatafiles/ainfopca.v3.1.2.CodeLists.xlsx">PCA Product Info CodeList</a></li></ul> <h2 id="usage-examples"><a href="#usage-examples" class="header-anchor">#</a> Usage Examples</h2> <h3 id="publish-open-data-standard-pca-product"><a href="#publish-open-data-standard-pca-product" class="header-anchor">#</a> Publish Open Data Standard PCA Product</h3> <h4 id="get-accounts-product-request"><a href="#get-accounts-product-request" class="header-anchor">#</a> Get Accounts Product Request</h4> <div class="language- extra-class"><pre class="language-text"><code>GET /accounts/22289/product HTTP/1.1
